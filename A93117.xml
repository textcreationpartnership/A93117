            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Having had cauſe my ſelfe to ſuſpect mine own condition, have been put to ſearch &amp; try my ſelf, and not willing to bee miſtaken in a point of ſo high concernment, I did lay and bind up together theſe Meditations (tending to the anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and the turning of the inſide outward of a Chriſtian) to be as a Looking-glaſs or Touchſtone for my help herein. And finding them ſomewhat uſefull for mine own purpoſe, and ſuppoſing they may be ſo alſo to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in my caſe; And having vehement cauſe to ſuſpect, that many thouſands amongſt us in this golden time, go with the wind and tyde in the general profeſſion of the Goſpel, and know not (becauſe they try not) what they are, or whither they are going, or what they doe: Therefore I have ſent it amongst you as a watch-word. And now conſider, were there any one amongſt you to have a goodly Mannor in a remote country for which
<pb facs="tcp:170417:3"/> he hath a conveyance for the payment down of a little ſum of money, and is to go ſhortly thither to ſhew his conveyance, pay his mony, and take his poſſeſſion: And ſhould I tell him his couveyance hath a flaw in it, and this is to be helpen before he go, and that the mony he iutends to carry will not paſs for currant there; will he not be willing to hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advice from me? To this purpoſe is all this that I am ſaying; That your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as it now stands is not good for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the money you intend to carry with you, that you have to lay down for Chriſt, will not be taken for currant there. If I ſhould tell any of you that are trading with your whole ſtock, whether you ſhall thrive or not, or that you are in the way to be undone, and how you may thrive and be exceeding rich: Or if I ſhould tell you that are now going a voyage by Sea in a Ship, wherein you adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your lives and all your eſtate in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſage between Rocks and Sands: Or you that are going about a work of mighty concernment, in a journey by land, in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way, where are Robbers, Lyons, Bears, Wolves, Brakes, Pits, &amp;c. and there is but
<pb facs="tcp:170417:3"/> one way of ſafety onely, and that you are in the dangerous way, and ſhould offer to put you in the ſafe way: Or if I ſhould tell any of you that ſtand to be choſen to a place of Preferment, that the having of it will make him, and the loſing of it will undoe him, that he is out of the way for it, and which way hee may be ſure of it, who would not hearken to me? How acceptable would my conuſel be to ſuch? My deſign therfore in this word of Advice is, to ſhew you how amongſt all your gettings you may get wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 4. 7.</note>, and in your trading pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that incomparable Pearl, which to get with the loſs of all is an incomparble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 45, 46, 47.</note>; and to put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the narrow way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, which ſo few find, and ſo many are miſtaken in, who then would not but hearken to it? who would but be at the coſt and pains to buy and read it? And now if any one by the reading hereof ſhall find himſelf to be miſtaken and out of the right way, it will be his advantage to be guided into it: It is better to run again than to run amiſs, <note place="margin">Melius eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere quam male currere.</note> and to beginne all again than to
<pb facs="tcp:170417:4"/> end that which being ended will be to no purpoſe. And for others that are in the right way, albeit they may be hereby ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what affrighted and ſhaken, yet it <note place="margin">Bonum eſt timere.</note> will make to their faſter ſettlement at laſt. The laſt chapter of the Book <note place="margin">* Hag. 2. 7. 9 Eph. 5. 6. Prov. 28. 14</note> is a peece of another mans, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the fourth chapter of the Book; for the further clearing of this point; <hi>That true Grace doth not lye in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or quantity, but in the nature and quality.</hi> And it is like to the man, <hi>learned indeed.</hi> All the defects and mistakes of my part of the work, muſt be imputed to me &amp; the Printer. All the good of it (if any bee therein) muſt be attributed much of it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, ſome living, ſome dead, from whom I borrowed it. But (be it whoſe it will) if you get any good by it; give to God the glory, for to him it doth belong; And look on me as a poor well wiſher to all that enquire what they may doe to be ſaved.</p>

               <p>Sincerity is that holy Frame of ſoule, wrought in it by Gods ſpirit, whereby the ſoule ſtands right to God in its purpoſe and endeavour to underſtand his mind from his word, that thereby it may exactly pleaſe him in all things which he requireth therein. And ſuch a heart wherein this Sincerity is, is called a right heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. a whole heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 1. 119. 2. a perfect heart, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 4. 15. 14. &amp;c. A pure heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. and a ſingle heart, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5. And he that hath ſuch a heart, we call the true or Sincere Chriſtian, or the Chriſtian indeed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 47.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subsection">
               <head>The Nature of Sincerity.</head>
               <p>To open this a little. This Sincerity lieth within: it is a heart work, or buſineſſe in the Soule, wherein the ſpirit of God doth dwell.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170417:10"/> And therefore it is ſet forth in Scripture by the Metaphor of the Root of a Tree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. or <hi>Foundation</hi> of a building, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. It is a frame of the heart, it ſpreads it ſelfe through the whole heart or Soule, underſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will, and affections. And there is an habitualneſſe, and conſtant tenor and temper in it. And it is ſuch a thing, as like a ſpring that runs, it ſtreams &amp; makes them reliſh of it: doth run into all the motions and operations of the Soule and body, called by one the proper quality of our obedience (if it may be ſaid to be a grace of it ſelfe, and not a thing that doth mingle it ſelfe with all graces, and (as one calls it) the Spirituall tune of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Soule) it is then certainly a grace made up of many ſpirituall and choyce graces, like as was the holy oyle powred on the head and garments of the High-Prieſts, compounded and made up of many precious Ingredients. For it muſt ſpring from the new life of the new Creature (the Soule whereof is Chriſt) which hath within it, and muſt include Faith, love, and the reſt of the Graces that accompany ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For it muſt flow from the pure and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven workings of the internall Principles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ends. And therefore if a man act never ſo much in duties, and have not a divine Spirituall Spring, a heart impulſed, and moved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170417:11"/> by Gods ſpirit acting in it: If there be not an acting of all the graces together in a harmony purely and really towards God, this Sincerity is not there. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We call it the work of the Spirit, and, ſo it muſt needs be, for as the naturall life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſprings from the Soule within; ſo all the life of grace in the Soule, ſprings from the ſpirit of Chriſt within the Soule. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 63.</p>
               <p>We ſay the work begins with a mind ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned by the Word and Spirit of God. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. For without knowledge the heart cannot be good, and without this there can be no Faith, no foundation of any Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor any thing wherein, or whereby it may ſhew it ſelfe. And therefore when the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. 10. prayeth for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they might be ſincere, he begins with this, <hi>And thus I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgement, that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be ſincere &amp;c.</hi> So that the Sincere Chriſtian is not only true, cordiall and reall in what he thinketh, ſaith and doth, but that which he thinketh, ſaith and doth, is generally according to the truth of the Goſpell, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. And, <hi>as many as walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, &amp;c. 3 Ioh. 4. 2 Ioh. 3. 4. I rejoyced greatly that I found of thy Children walking in truth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170417:11"/> as we have received a commandement, &amp;c. Coll.</hi> 1. 13 2, 3, 4. 5. For otherwiſe, let what will be done, and let a man act in what he doth never ſo much <hi>ex animo</hi> from his very heart, and ſincerely according to the light he hath received (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe upon falſe Principles) yet may he be called an Hypocrite.</p>

               <p>Hypocriſie is an evill frame of Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man would ſeem to be right towards God, and to be carried to act really for him, but in truth it is not ſo. Or where a man pretends to more good towards God or Men, without, then is within him, or whereby he would ſeem to himſelfe or others to be better then he is.

A crooked heart, or perverſe heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12 8. and a divided heart, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10. 2. 7. 14. And he that hath ſuch a heart, is he we intend by, and call the Hypocrite.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subsection">
               <head>The Nature of Hypocriſie:</head>
               <p>But to open this Hypocriſie, and the nature of it, and to ſhew who we mean by this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; we are to know firſt of all: that Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſtands in oppoſition to the Truth and reality of a thing, and it ſtands alſo in oppoſition to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170417:13"/> the Sincerity of a mans intention in the thing, and ſo Hypocriſy may be with reference to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe. 2. By the Hypocrite in generall we doe not intend one that appears worſe then he is indeed, as <hi>Peter</hi> did when he denied his Lord' (which yet he did not without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, being ſo well acquainted with him) Nor by the Hypocrite doe we intend, one that acts this part for once, or is deceitfull in one thing as <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſome others with him were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 14. And as the beſt men ſometimes may be, and are unfainedly ſorry for the ſame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Nor doe we intend by the Hypocrite in generall, ſuch a man, as by humane frailty only falleth into leſſer ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 19 For in many things we offend all, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. <hi>And there is not a man that liveth, and ſinneth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 47. 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5. Nor doe we hereby intend him, that by ſtrength of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may fall into greater ſinnes againſt his purpoſe, whereof he doth afterwards repent, as <hi>David, Solomon, Peter,</hi> and others did, and the beſt of Gods own people may doe. For as a man may be in ſome Acts without Hypocriſie, and yet be an Hypocrite: ſo a man may be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall in ſome Acts, and yet be ſincere; and there is ſome Hypocriſie in the beſt, who at one time or other, or in ſome things, may appeare better then they are.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170417:13"/>
               <p>3. But by the Hypocrite we meane him, that is an Hypocritie through his heart and life, one that for holineſſe and goodneſſe, ſeems to others, and perhaps alſo to himſelfe, to be what he is not, but yet ought to be; or one that deſires to make a faire ſhew without, of that goodneſſe and holineſſe, which he hath not, nor any root or foundation of, within him. He is one that ſeems to be, and to act the part of a true Chriſtian, but is none; he appears in the ſhape of a living Chriſtian, but is dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Thou hast a name to live, but art dead. Rom.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>He is not a Iew that is one outwardly.</hi> He doth ſeem to be a Saint or Angell of Light, and is a Devill, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 70. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. Hence it is that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are compared to Tares, which are like to Wheat <hi>Matth</hi> 13. 25. As Hypocriſie is compared to Leaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 1. which cannot be known by ſight, ſo the Hypocrite is compared to a wolfe in a ſheeps skin: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. For the likenes and agreement that is in appearance between him and the true Chriſtian, for they are indeed very hardly to be known the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the Hypocrite having ſomething done upon, and in him, like to the work of Regenaration wrought upon, and in the elect of God, he calleth himſelfe, and is called by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the name of them that are regenerate, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Being borne againe, not of corruptible ſeed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170417:14"/> &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Which call themſelves Iewes, &amp;c. Eſay</hi> 48. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>Which are called by the name of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> And hence it is that Hypocrites are called falſe brethren of the true Chriſtians, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. Falſe Apoſtles, and falſe Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. And as they are amongſt, ſo they are ſaid to be of the people of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2 18, 19. The Hypocrite he looks a great deale better then he is, he promiſeth much more then he doth performe, for his beſt ſide is without, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6. 2. 23. 27. 26. 14. 15. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. He is like to an Apple, all faire without but quite rotten within. But the beſt ſide of the Sincere man is within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. <hi>He is all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within, Cant.</hi> 1. 5. Or he is the ſame within and without, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. <hi>His mouth ſpeaketh wiſdome, &amp;c. The Law of God is in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is that the Hypocrite is compared to a painted Sepulchre or wall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 3. To a Cloud without water, carried about with every wind, <hi>Iud.</hi> 12. which notes his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, for he is unſtable in all his wayes, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 8. And to a wandring ſtarre. <hi>Iude</hi> 13. that makes as faire a ſhew, and promiſes as much by its influences, as the fixed ſtarre doth. So he ſeems to promiſe much to God and Man, and performes nothing, makes a faire ſhew for a time, and then vaniſheth away, and comes to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170417:14"/> nothing, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Your goodneſſe is as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clowd, and as the early dew it goeth away, Mat.</hi> 13. Hence it is he is compared in Scripture, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Bow, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 16. and in our common compariſon, to Rowers in the Boat, whiles in their pretence they look one way, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents they goe the clean contrary way; or like to an Eagle that ſoars high towards Heaven, that he may have the more advantage upon his prey upon the Earth, on which his eye is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            <div type="subsection">
               <head>The parts of Hypocriſy. Or wherein it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe.</head>
               <p>So the Hypocrites work lyeth in two things. 1. In the Simulation of good, that he may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and feigne that which indeed is not, that he may make ſhew of that good which he hath not at all, or elſe not in that meaſure he maketh ſhew of, being eſpecially ſwayed with the ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſpects of gaine and glory: And ſo his main ſtudy is, that he may ſeem better then he is, and that he may ſeem to doe better then he doth.</p>
               <p>2. In Diſſimulation, which is either of evill or of good, in diſſembling and concealing that which indeed is evill; ſo his maine care is, that he may not appeare to be ſo bad as he is, and to doe ſo bad as he doth. And this diſſembling and concealing of evill, is threefold. 1. Of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170417:15"/> in doing, he hideth that which he is in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a pretence of doing the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So <hi>Herod</hi> his intent of the Murther, with pretence of the worſhip of Chriſt; <hi>Abſalon</hi> his Treaſon, with the Religion of a vow; <hi>Iudas</hi> his Covetouſneſſe, with the ſhew of liberality to the poore; and the Jewes their envy to Chriſt, with a ſhew of duty to Caeſar 2. He diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth that which he is about to doe. So <hi>Haman Eſter</hi> 5. 10. refrained himſelfe, and concealed his malice and miſchiefe intended to the Jewes.

The ſin of the Hypocrite is therefore not a ſin of infirmity but a ſinne of malignity, perverſeneſſe &amp; contempt.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the ſeverall kinds of Hypocriſy and Sincerity. And of the Severall ſorts of Hypocrites.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HYpocriſie, and ſo Sincerity alſo (as to the kinds thereof) are conſiderable in men diverſe wayes. 1. In reference to the man in whom it is in generall, as it reſpects his heart in what he doth, whether he be rotten or ſound therein, So Chriſt calleth the Phariſes Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. often. 2. With reference to the matter wherein it is acted and ſheweth it ſelfe. And ſo it is conſiderable alſo, Either in relation to the inward affections and motions of the heart; or the words of the mouth; or the works of the hands: It is conſiderable, as to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and motions of the heart within, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be indeed, as they ſeem to be in ſhew,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170417:18"/> by the words and works without. For a man may pretend to true Faith, Love, Repentance, and other Graces and works of the Spirit, whereof there may be ſome appearance or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon him, and which he may think he hath in truth within him, but hath it not indeed, nor any thing, but the picture and Image thereof only. For there are ſome things like to that are not ſaving Graces: and there is no ſaving Grace in truth in a Saint, but there may be and is, the likeneſſe of it in an Hypocrite. There are naturall gifts and works ariſing from the naturall conſtitution and temper of a man. And ſo a man may be naturally meeke, loving, kind, mercifull, curteous and peaceable. There may be, and are many very commendable qualities wrought in a man by Education, reading, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and the like. And hereby ſome have attained to virtues like to ſaving Graces. And there are Spirituall Gifts, or common operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit of God, diſtinct from ſaving grace which is called unfeighned grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 37. The grace of Gods Elect, and Grace which doth accompany Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. And ſo a man may have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any ſaving Grace, and yet not have the Grace it ſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27, 28. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 36, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21, 23. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 136. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Exod:</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. 2. Hypocriſie and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170417:18"/> Sincerity alſo, are conſiderable as to the words whether they be ſo in the intention of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in themſelves, and may produce the effect they doe <hi>prima facie,</hi> ſeeme to be and to produce. Or they be not lyes ſpoken in Hypocriſie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. and dangerous Errors under glorious pretences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. Theſe things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as to workes. And this not only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a work really done from his heart that doth it, but that it be ſuch a work as is good and ought to be done. And ſo Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Sincerity are conſiderable in relation to all the actings of a mans whole life, as that of <hi>Amaziah</hi> 2 Chron. 25, 2. Scribes and Phariſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and others 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 62. Or to ſome particular actings of a mans life; as that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 34. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 48. 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 12. 38. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 19. 10. Hypocriſy alſo (as to the work) may be ſaid to be either expreſſe; which is either where the thing done is, being a good thing and commanded by God, is done, either againſt the heart, or not with the whole heart, or to a good, but to a ſiniſter end. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Phill.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. 23, 22. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 16. Or it is Implicite and interpretative. And ſo are all the glorious works of Piety, Mercy, Charity, and Juſtice done by the Profeſſor of Religion, by men out of Chriſt, and without Faith, though done with never ſo much ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170417:19"/> integrity, ſeeing they are not of faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. For as the works are but <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinnes, ſo are they in ſome degree more or leſſe done in Hypocriſie, and they Hypocrites that doe them, 1 <hi>King</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29 <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 29. And all theſe things thus done in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, as before in any ſort, are oppoſed to the ſincere obedience of the Faithfull, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 10. 2 Kings 23. 25. 2 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. <hi>Jer</hi> 24. 7. <hi>Eſay</hi> 29. 13. Of ſuch Hypocrites as we have ſpoken of, that are rotten at heart, there are diverſe ſorts. There are Hypocriticall Nations (that is) ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as live not up to their Profeſſion. Such was the Jewiſh Nation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 6. And ſuch is any Nation now profeſſing the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that live not becoming Chriſtians. And there are Hypocriticall perſons. And amongſt theſe Hypocriticall <note place="margin">The Groſſe Hypocritie.</note> Perſons. There are Groſſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and Refined Hypocrites. The Groſſe Hypocrite is alſo either more Groſſe, or leſſe Groſſe, yet both of them are very groſſe. The more groſſe is one that either doth notoriouſly diſſemble againſt his own light, in what he doth of purpoſe to cheat and deceive others. The leſſe Groſſe is one who doth maintain ſome groſſe Errors, or live in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170417:19"/> ſome groſſe practiſe of Sinne. There are Hypocrites in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">The Nature of his Hypocriſie.</note> and Hypocrites in Action. The Hypocrite in Opinion we call him that pretendeth to Truth of opinion, to hold forth the very truths of God out of love unto them, and yet maintaineth Error and Hereſie. And the Hypocrite in Action we call him that pretendeth to holineſſe of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to Gods will, without in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, where he hath no inward and hearty affection thereunto. And both theſe are either more groſſe or more refined. The more groſſe Hypocrite in Opinion, is one who maketh a great ſhew outwardly, of holding forth Gods Truth, where he is inwardly in his heart, ſuch an enemy to it, that he ſpreadeth abroad his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and this he doth knowingly, and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceive. So it is more then probable did the Phariſes in ſome of their opinions, which they could not but know to be Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. So ſome of the Gnoſticks of old, taught a lawfulneſſe in Chriſtians, to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by a Goſpell liberty, and to deny Chriſt in caſe of perſecution, to ſave themſelves from death. So Papiſts and other Hereticks now, who teach unlawfulnes of marriages of meats, and other ſuch like things, contrary to the clear evidence of the word. Theſe no doubt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170417:20"/> (many of them) did and doe know that they did and doe maintain Errors and Hereſies, and yet they did and doe continue to maintain them for ſome advantage to themſelves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Speaking lyes in Hypocriſie.</hi> The more Groſſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in Action or practiſe, is he that aſſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a forme of Godlineſſe, and pretends to a forſaking of ſinne and infidelity, by Faith and Repentance within him, when he hath only the ſhew, and appearance thereof. And he neither hath nor intendeth, or deſireth to have, or doe any ſuch thing, and knoweth he doth diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and doth it of purpoſe to deceive others thereby. This indeed is an Hypocrite in graine, or an Hypocrite in the higheſt degree, when a man ſhall pretend to the Truth of Religion, and doth make it his whole deſigne, trade, or work, therein to act Hypocriſie only. Such a one is ſaid to be a Cheator or Juglor, that ſheweth tricks, and maketh appearances of things that really are not ſo as they appeare; the ſame word in the originall, it is ſaid, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for both. And he is compared to a perſon diſguiſed, or a Stage-player, who in the ſight of others, may act the part of a King, or honeſt man, but when he is in his tyring houſe, is but a baſe varlet, and he knowes himſelfe to be ſo. And ſuch an Hypocrite the Devill is, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appears like an Angell of light, that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170417:20"/> may doe the more miſchief; we call him ſo, that Saints may not be ignorant of his wiles, and the Scripture warrants it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 24. And ſo when he appears moſt innocently and piouſly, he acts moſt wickedly and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly: ſo <hi>Joab</hi> covered his perfidiouſneſſe to <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa</hi> with friendly words, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like ſalutations when he murthered them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 27. and 20. 9. And <hi>Iſmael,</hi> covered his bloody purpoſe to kill the eighty men, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile-like with Teares, <hi>Jer:</hi> 41. 6. Such were the Scribes and Phariſees, who Viper-like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their venemous teeth, under their gumms of glorious ſhews and pretences, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 15, 16 <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 3, 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25, 26. Such were <hi>Cain, Saul,</hi> and others mentioned in Scripture, who made their Religion and profeſſion, a cloak only for the wickedneſſe. And ſuch a one is Antichriſt the Arch-hypocrite of the World) who cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Lyons teeth, and Serpents taile, with Womans haire, a Mans face, and the hornes of a Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 8. &amp; 13. 1. So falſe teachers do cover themſelves and their Wolfiſh cruelty, with ſheeps cloathing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. and theſe Scribes and Phariſes made their Religion but a colour and cloak for their wickedneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes Phariſes Hypocrites, for you devoure Widdowes Houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Abſalom</hi> pretended the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170417:21"/> worſhip of God, Zeale to Juſtice, and love to the people of God, when he intended nothing, but the advancement of himſelfe to the Crown, with the death of his Father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2. to the 11. ſo <hi>Iehu</hi> pretends to a zealous Reformation in Religion, and execution of Gods command, when he intended nothing but his own advancement to the Throne, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 15, 16, 17, 18, 30, 31. So thoſe named in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. and 3. 9. <hi>Which ſay they are Jewes and are not, but the Synagogue of Satan, 2 Cor. 11. 13, 14. Falſe Apoſtles, deceitfull workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, &amp;c. Rom: 16. 18.

And that they doe ſo of purpoſe for ſome advantage to themſelves. The leſſe Groſſe Hypocrite, we call him that is a groſſe Heretick or Idolater, as a Papiſt, Arrian, and the like, or one that together with his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very looſe in his converſation, as thoſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 1, 2. &amp;c. and 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4, 5.

So many a man in the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and his carriage with-out pretends to truth of Grace within, where there is ſomething like it, and he doth judge it to be there in Truth, and that he is not an Hypocrite but upright. And it is not to be doubted but that a man may be an Hypocrite, and not know it. He may doe all things according to the letter of the word right in appearance, and as to the reality of what he doth in Truth, and be hereupon perſwaded, that he hath grace in his heart in uprightneſſe, is in the favour of God, and in a happy and ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ſo continue to his dying day, and yet be damned at laſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the wayes of death, Prov.</hi> 30, 12. <hi>There is a generation that are Pure in their own eyes, and yet not waſhed from their filthineſſe.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>The fooliſh Virgins. Matt.</hi> 25 and the young Man <hi>Matt.</hi> 29. Were all of them reall in what they made ſhew of, and pretended to. And yet they were Hypocrites, and ſo are all ſuch as ſhall doe likewiſe, as many doe at this day, who pretend to be true Chriſtians and Saints, &amp;c. And doe make a profeſſion of that, and doe appeare to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170417:22"/> others and themſelves, to be ſuch as they are not, for they would be thought to be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and yet have not the Soule of a true Chriſtian within them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>For he is not a Iew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh. But he is a Iew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God, Rev.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Thou haſt tryed them that ſay they are Apostles and are not, and haſt found them lyars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The leſſe refined Hypocrite we call him that poſſibly may either hold ſome more groſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as ſome Superſtitious. Perſons that are only Popiſh in ſome points, or ſome worſe practiſes, or are not ſo exact in their lives as the former ſort. And yet perhaps may be ſecure, and judge themſelves in an eſtate good enough, Ia. 1. 25. 26 So that we call them more or leſſe Groſſe, as there is more of their wills and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by deſigne in their Profeſſion, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted outſide of good to device, Or as their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill opinions and practiſes they hold or doe, are more or leſſe evill. And more or leſſe Refined as they are more or leſſe privy to their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake and deceit; or as the opinions or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they hold or act, are more or leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. This difference of Hypocrites, the Apoſtle ſeems to hold forth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Acts 3. 17.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170417:22"/> 
               <hi>I did it ignorantly.</hi> ſo that there is a ſimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as well as a willfull knowing Hypocrite. The firſt ſort of theſe Hypocrites deceive others only. But the latter ſort, deceive themſelves alſo, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 21, 26. <hi>If any ſeem to be Religious &amp;c. that deceiveth his own heart, &amp;c.</hi> So the fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that were never diſordered by the wiſe nor themſelves till the gate of grace was ſhut upon them. Some make a third ſort of Hypocrite between the two forenamed ones, and make him ſuch a one that doth ſomewhat ſuſpect himſelfe, and yet for ſome ſelfe ends continues and bears up in his profeſſion as long as he can.</p>
            <p>And amongſt theſe diverſe ſorts of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, there are found theſe differences. Or they may be diſtinguiſhed thus. 1. There is a malitious or ſpitefull Hypocrite, and he is ſuch a one as doth hate and maligne the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and will doe to him all the miſchiefe he can. And this is ſuch a one as for this, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Viper or Serpent, for his venome and miſchiefe againſt, and danger to the true Church. And ſuch were the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 24. and 23. 33. <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 70. and 8. 44. called therefore Gods enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 4, 29. and 79. 26. 14. <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 6. <hi>your Brethren that hate you &amp;c.</hi> 2. There is a looſe or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Hypocrite, one that together with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170417:23"/> of Religion, is very licentious and looſe in his converſation. Such were thoſe in <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 1, 10, 11, 12. &amp;c. and thoſe in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 3. There is a ſtrict or an exact Hypocrite, one that for his outward converſation is as faire, and looks as beautifull as the moſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, but is rotten within. Such were the Fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Mat:</hi> 22. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob:</hi> But it may be objected. That we call him an Hypocrite, that doth what he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and from his heart, which is no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. We grant that men may be and are in their hearts within, oft times in that which is evill in opinion and practiſe, the ſame as they are in their profeſſion and appearance without. So we find in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 9. <hi>I verily thought with myſelfe that I ought to doe many things againſt the name of Ieſus, &amp;c</hi> &amp; Chriſt tells his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Io.</hi> 16. 2. that the time was coming, that whoſoever ſhould kill them, ſhould think they did God ſervice in it. And we are perſwaded that moſt of the Common people, under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious formes of Religion in theſe times, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Quakers, and the like, are cordiall, and doe take themſelves to be in the right. But 2. If we ſay to this farther, that a man may doe many things well, and (in his own judgement
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170417:23"/> and opinion) according to the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet the perſon ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ſo farre from being a Sincere good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that he is (all the while) a deſperate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and (in that ſenſe we now ſpeak of) an Hypocrite. So it was with S. <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 23. 1. where he ſaith, <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience before God untill this day.</hi> His meaning is, though he had fiercely perſecuted the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, yet he thought he did well, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (though erring) concurring with him, ſo that he ſinned not againſt his conſcience, but acted according to that light which was in him, even then when he ſinned againſt the Law of God and the Goſpell. 3. A thing may be done truly as to the reallity of it, but not truly as to the formality of it, Hypocriſie therefore is ſaid to lye in two things, or to be conſidered two wayes. 1. As it ſtands in oppoſition to the truth and reality of a thing. 2. As it ſtands in oppoſition to the Sincerity of a mans inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the thing. A man out of Chriſt is not a Chriſtian indeed, no more then a dead corps without a Soule is a man. And that he doth, let him doe it never ſo really and cordially, cannot be good, becauſe he that dot it, is evill <hi>Gen:</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Mat:</hi> 12. 33. And if the thing to be done be evill, let it be done never ſo cordially and really, it cannot be good. And the thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170417:24"/> done, albeit it be for the manner well done as to the reality and intention, yet if the thing done be in the matter, and in its own nature evill, it cannot be good, a thing alſo that in its own nature is good, may yet for the manner and forme of doing it, be evill. And to this therefore we are to know, That the thing that the thing that is ſaid of done, is for the matter of it, good or evill; If good, yet it may be done amiſſe in the manner. In 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 25, 2. It is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> that <hi>he did that which was right,</hi> (that is, that which was according to his will, and pleaſed him well) <hi>but not with a perfect heart;</hi> though the thing he did, as alſo the greateſt part of that which <hi>Iehu</hi> did, was according to Gods command, and that which (for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it) God approved when done, yet they did it with an eye to themſelves only, out of ſelfe-love, and for their ſelfe intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage only, and not of any love to God, or care, or deſire to pleaſe or glorify him in it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 10. 6, 7. But if the thing (for the matter of it) (be it opinion or practice) be evill, the doing or ſaying thereof from the heart, will not make it good, or better then it is. For if by this, the opinion or Action may be juſtified, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excuſed, then muſt the moſt horrid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practiſes that ever were held or done by this, be ſo farre countenanced, ſuch as the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170417:24"/> opinions againſt Chriſts Divinity, and that to eat fleſh is as bad as to eate Soules, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the killing of the Saints of God, and the ſacrificing of mens children to Idolls, and the worſhipping of the Hoaſt of Heaven. For all this thoſe that did maintaine and act them (at leaſt ſome of them) were perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of. And if no men of any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or perſwaſion amongſt us, ſhall judge themſelves only to be the true Chriſtians, and all others Antichriſtians, and ſhall take up this perſwaſion, and perhaps from thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 137. 8, 9. That as they are able they may and muſt deſtroy all the reſt. Or (being of a levelling judgement) that they may take away as they are able from others that have much to make an equality. May they therefore doe it? or is the thing ever the better becauſe they are perſwaded they may, nay (it may be) that they muſt doe it? and is not the thing being ſinfull and againſt Gods law, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtill notwithſtanding their perſwaſion. This poynt and caſe of Conſcience is cleared and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to our hands by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his own caſe, who tells us in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. that he in what he did was a <hi>blaſpheamer, a perſecutor, and injurious, but that he obtained mercy,</hi> And we doe not find that the opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of thoſe Hereticks in <hi>Jude,</hi> and 2 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2. and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170417:25"/> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. are ſaid to be ever the leſſe ſinfull or dangerous to ſome, becauſe they did probably believe them to be Truth. We grant it to be true, that it doth ſomewhat leſſen the offence, becauſe it is of Ignorance in them that are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet we affirme that it is ſo much the greater again, as there is more of the will in it.</p>
            <p>5. But there is much of Hypocriſie alſo in theſe perſons in theſe caſes. For they pretend to be indeed the only enlightned men and Saints, to have the ſpirit. That the truth is with them, and that their way is Gods way and the true and the right way. Whereas they are in truth but Hypocrites, Falſe Teachers, Devills in the appearance of Angells of Light, underſtand not what they ſay, not having the Spirit, and going themſelves, and leading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with them to deſtruction, <hi>Jude.</hi> 2 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. <hi>Prov:</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>

               <p>The Sincerity or Hypocriſy of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, will appeare and lye much in this, as he hath or hath not within him a Principle and Foundation for what is acted, and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare without him.

               <p>2. It lyeth much in this, as the Profeſſor is taught of Chriſt. The true Chriſtian he doth firſt of all come to Chriſt, and is taught of him by his word, and knows the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, as it is in Jeſus, and carrieth the ſame with him to direct his way in his opinion and converſation.

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether the Truth of Grace doe lye in the degree or Quantity, or in the Quality and Nature of it?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are ſome that make a new, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Hypocriſie, and ſay it is, where there is truth of Grace within, but yet, not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace; Or would have the truth of Grace to conſiſt only in the degree, or meaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ſo admit Hypocrites to have the truth of grace in them. But this we take to be a miſtake. And that there is no true grace (we mean) none of the grace that accompanieth Salvation, or is the grace of Gods elect only (for this only, and not common grace, we call True grace) in any meaſure or degree in the heart of any Hypocrite, nor is any thing ſo to be accounted, as it comes from him. Somewhat that is like unto it, we admit to be in an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. As painted fire is like to true fire, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall Pictures are like to the things they ſet forth, and an Artificiall Flower, is like to the true naturall Flower, but it is not the thing it ſelfe. So that which is in the heart of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is not true Grace, 2 Tim. 3. 5. the which we affirme for theſe following reaſons. 1. The Hypocrite in his heart, is as a corrupt tree twice dead and pluckt up by the Rootes, <hi>Iude</hi> 12. <hi>Luke</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170417:36"/> 6. 43. and therefore cannot but bring forth corrupt fruit, he cannot bring forth living fruit; he bringeth forth Fruit, but it is not good fruit. For untill the tree be made good, the fruit cannot be good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits. Doe men gather grapes of Thornes, or figgs of Thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree bringeth forth good fruit: But a corrupt tree bringeth forth evill fruit.</hi> He is alſo a corrupt Fountain, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 11, 12. <hi>Doth a Fountain ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet water and bitter? Can the Figtree beare Olives? &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 12 34, 35. <hi>O generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vipers, how can ye being evill ſpeak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 6. 42. 2. If there be an unfeyned and Sincere grace, an unfeyned repentance, Faith and Love; then there muſt be ſomething like to it, that may be called a feyned and counterfeit Repentance, Faith and love. But there is the one, and therefore the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. 2 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 24. 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 3 4. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 9. 10. If there be an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and immortall grace, then there is a corruptible and mortall grace. But there is the one and the other, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 22. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22, 23. <hi>Mat:</hi> 16. 16, 17. If there be a living Faith and hope, then there is a dead Faith and hope: But there is the one and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170417:36"/> other, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Iames</hi> 2 26. And if there be a ſpeciall grace, proper and peculiar to the elect, then there is another kind of generall grace, which is common, and is the ſeeming grace of Hypocrites: But there is the one, and therefore there is the other, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. And if there be a grace that accompanieth Salvation, then is there ſomewhat elſe like to it, which doth not carry to Salvation: But there is the one; and therefore there is the other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. And that this is a good kind of Argument, we have <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitutes lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <hi>pag</hi> 188. in theſe words, <hi>Nec Paulus requireres à filiis Dei fidem non fictam,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>niſi quia multi ſibi audacter arrogant quod non habent; &amp; inani fuco vel alios, &amp; interdum ſeipſos fallunt.</hi> 3. If ſaving grace lye only in the degree and meaſure, then how ſhall a man know the Truth of his grace, or ever get aſſurance of his own good eſtate thereby. For who can diſcern the parting poynt? who can ſay juſt ſuch a degree of Love, Faith, Repentance is ſincere and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the next degree is ſhort of it, and not ſaving? 4. By the Scripture it ſelfe, and by the experience of Antient and Moderne times, we find it thus. That the grace of moſt Chriſtians is at the firſt, as the ſtrength of Children, very ſmall and weake, and doth commonly grow ſtrong by degrees and in time, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6. 30. &amp; 8.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170417:37"/> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 9. And that ſome when they are perfectly grown up, are not ſo able &amp; ſhining as others. And that it is in this, as it is in the naturall body, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15. 41. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 13. We find alſo that ſome true Chriſtians, who for meaſure and quantity of ſaving grace have had as much thereof as moſt men, yet ſome times by occaſion of ſome temptation without, the working of their own corruption within, and by Gods leaving of them to their own ſtrength, have fallen fowly and deepely in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, almoſt (at leaſt in their own ſenſe) to the loſſe of all ſaving grace within them. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. prayeth that God would reſtore his holy ſpirit againe to him, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, That in his preſent apprehenſion, he had utterly loſt it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1, 8, 9. And it is in this in Chriſt Myſticall, as it is in the Naturall body of man, which may fall into a ſwoune or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe by which it may be as dead for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, no ſymptomes of life appearing, and yet life in the body ſtill. Alſo we find ſome of Gods people, under ſad deſertions all the daies of their life, and even as dead men, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little Faith appearing in them. It hath been all darkneſſe, and no light with them, the Clouds have been between the light of Gods countenance and them always; And yet the Sun hath ſhined, The light of Gods
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170417:37"/> countenance hath been upon them, though they have not ſeen it. Who ſhall doubt of theſe mens Sincerity, and that they are pretious Saints not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding? <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voyce of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſſe and hath no light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Pſ. 88. 1. <hi>O Lord God of my ſalvation &amp;c.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>I am accounted with them that goe down into the pit, I am as a man that hath no strength, free amongst the dead &amp;c.</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face from mee, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo we find ſometimes ſuch as have little Grace in appearance, yet by an additionall ſtrength given in on a ſuddaine from God, made able to doe very great things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34, 35, 36. <hi>Of Weakneſſe were made ſtrong &amp;c.

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:170417:38"/> 15. 5. Alſo we find ſuch as have had and ſhewed much Grace, and had in them much ſtrength at ſome time, at other times very weak as <hi>Ionas, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and others. And thus God would have it for the making of way to the exaltation of his own glory and humiliation of his own ſervants, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30, 31. <hi>That no fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if there be any light of true grace, though but litle as the light of a candle going out, though with ſome corruptions therewith ſtinking like to the ſnuffe of a candle, he will cheriſh and perfect it. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170417:39"/> that ſuch as have only deſires of Grace, and ſome ſlender beginnings thereof, ſhall be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly dealt with by Chriſt till they come to more maturity and perfection, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall gather the Lambs with his armes, and carry them in his boſome, and gently lead thoſe that are with young, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 28, 29, 30. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, &amp;c. they ſhall renew their ſtrength, &amp;c.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170417:39"/> ſingular thing which is not in common grace, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>(i.)</hi> For all true and ſaving grace (whether little or great, weak or ſtrong) flowes from the Covenant of grace, made with the Elect only in Chriſt Jeſus, wherewith the Hypocrite hath nothing to doe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31. <hi>Rom:</hi> 11. 5, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50, 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. It may be Objected. That the way to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170417:41"/> heaven is a narrow way, that few find it, the Gate into it ſtraight, that few enter into it. That many ſhall ſtrive to enter into it, and ſhall not be able to enter. That the life of a Chriſtian is a dangerous and painfull life, like to the life of a Souldier, Pilgrim, Travailer, Husbandman, or painfull labourer. And that violence muſt be uſed to get into Heaven, or we cannot come there. And that he that gets in there, muſt not only fight for it, but overcome, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 6. 16. and 1. 19. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Mat:</hi> 11. 12. and therefore they inferre that great meaſures of Grace are abſolutely neceſſary to an eſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ:</hi> To which we Anſwer. That the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is confeſſed to be true. And the ſame is much more lively manifeſted in the weak then in the ſtrong Chriſtian, in him that hath little, then in him that hath much Grace. As in the Souldier, Husbandman, Travailer, or Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that notwithſtanding his ſickneſſe, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, faintneſſe, or other diſtempers, yet he fights ſtill, he goeth on his Journey ſtill, he doth his daies work for all this, but with the more ſtrife, danger, payne, and violence. And yet they goe on conquering and to conquer, and ſhall obtain a full victory at the laſt. But the conſequence is falſe, for the loweſt, weakeſt, ſmalleſt degree and meaſure of true grace, will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170417:41"/> ſo really, conſtantly, and victoriouſly, oppoſe ſinne as light oppoſeth darkneſſe, or truth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth falſhood, and therefore the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace, puts a man into an eſtate of grace, which will end in eternall glory.</p>

Oh but Chriſts diſciples muſt be able to leave Father and Mother, Wife and life, and all for his ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me: And he that loveth Sonne or Daughter more then mee, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not up his Croſſe and followeth after me is not worthy of me.</hi> Luke 14. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we anſwer, 1. That many of theſe ſpeeches of Chriſt, are Hyperbolicall, or Catechreſticall, and may not be taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter by any means, as Matt. 5. 33. <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> 39. 40. &amp;c. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turne to him the other alſo, &amp;c</hi> And ſo here the words are not ſimply to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Chriſt doth not teach men to be unnaturall to themſelves, or their relations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God and nature, for this were to teach contrary to himſelfe, and all his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by himſelfe and his Apoſtles elſewhere. But that he meaneth, by this is with reſpect to the preſent and ſucceeding times of Perſecution,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170417:42"/> in which caſe if it come to the Queſtion, that they muſt either deny, and ſo leave and looſe Chriſt, or they muſt leave and looſe Father and Mother, Wife, life and all, in this caſe they muſt be ready to leave and looſe them, and muſt leave them all for Chriſts ſake. As we are to love God above all, ſo we are to leave all for Gods ſake. And he that ſo doth, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded here and hereafter. <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 29. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 28, 29. &amp;c. And ſuch as feare God in ſuch a caſe, are ſo farre from having great meaſures of Grace, that they have not the leaſt meaſure of Grace, no not as of a grain of muſtard ſeed, &amp; are not worthy of him indeed, and will goe without him, <hi>Mat:</hi> 22. 8. 2. The words <hi>(worthy of me)</hi> in this place, as in diverſe others we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they doe intend no more but this, they are not meet or fit for my ſervice, to be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to be accounted gracious. ſo the words are taken in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 4. and 20. 35. and 21. 36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. 3. We grant 1. that the true Chriſtian ought ſo to love God and Chriſt at all times. 2. That it is in the nature of true Grace ſo to doe. 3. That the true Chriſtian doth earneſtly deſire and labour to attain to this perfection. And 4. He ſhall attain to this perfection at the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. It may be farther objected, that it is admitted of a Hypocrite, that he hath true

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwer hereunto, we ſay, 1. That the Scripture doth oftimes ſpeak according to mens opinion of things. 2. He may have truly the temporary grace which is the grace of the Hypocrite, and very like to the ſaving grace of the elect of God, and therefore he is ſaid to have it. 2. He thinks he hath true grace, and will not be perſwaded to the contrary, as one of a thing he dreameth. 3. That the Hypocrite himſelfe (be he here a member of a true viſible Church, and never ſo glorious a profeſſor) is in Gods account, and in truth, no Chriſtian, no more then the picture of a man is a man. Nor is part of Chriſts myſticall body, more then an artificiall Eye, Tooth, or Legge, is a part of the body to which it is annexed: And yet for his outward appearance, he is ſaid to be in Chriſt, <hi>Io.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not fruit &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2 17.

Yet are they not works really and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170417:43"/> truly done, nor done to or for God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth look upon, and account of them as workes not done at all, or as evill deeds, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Iſrael is an empty vine &amp;c.

Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>They have not cryed unto mee when they howled &amp;c.</hi> For as the prayer of the heart not uttered by the mouth, is notwithſtanding a Prayer in Gods account, ſo the Prayer of the tongue not in the heart, may be ſaid to be no Prayer to God at all, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 1. 13. In this ſenſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. it is ſaid that Circumciſion outward and not in the heart, is no Circumciſion. And ſo for the common Graces or gifts that are in the heart of an Hypocrite, albeit they be ſometimes for the likeneſſe they have to the true Graces, called by their names, <hi>Eſay</hi> 48. 2. <hi>Io:</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 2. <hi>Micha</hi> 3 11, 17. yet coming from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill man, and out of an evill heart, they cannot be good, <hi>Mat:</hi> 7. 11. &amp; 12. 35 The Lord doth not account of them, nor are they to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a Theologicall or ſpirituall ſenſe, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Graces at all, no more then painted fire is fire, or a thing a man doth fancy in his dreame,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170417:43"/> the thing it ſelfe: or counterfeit coyne true coyne. And as God herein takes the will for the deed, in that which is not, ſo in that which is, the deed without the will not to be at all, hence it is <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 64, 70. that <hi>Judas</hi> albeit he had a temporary faith, yet he is ſaid not to believe. But for the Text objected in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 24. <hi>That from him that hath not</hi> (that hath not indeed) <hi>ſhall be taken what he hath.</hi> Theſe words are in <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> It may perhaps be farther objected, that the oyle which the fooliſh Virgins (that were Hypocrites) had, was the ſame kind of oyle which the wiſe Virgins had, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For Anſwer to this we ſay, 1. That <hi>Theologica parabolica non eſt argumentativa.</hi> 2. That it is true, that the text ſaith, that the fooliſh Virgins had oyle in their Lamps, but it cannot appeare by the text, to be of the ſame kind of oyle that the wiſe Virgins had. Nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be ſo, for the wiſe had their ſupply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, but the fooliſh theirs from without them. We grant the Hypocrite to have ſeeming Grace or gifts, but not of the ſame kind with the true Chriſtian, whoſe oyle is of another kind, fed by the ſpirit of God within him, which ſpirit the Hypocrite hath not; His ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170417:44"/> grace, hath no rooting, as the feed of the ſtony and High way ground, and the building on the ſand. It hath not the cauſes of the true Graces, that are in the heart of the true Chriſtian, it is not ſo rooted and bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt and his ſpirit, it works not ſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to break and humble the heart for ſinne, and that out of a deep ſenſe of the love of God and Chriſt, ſo as to engage and faſten in it a root and foundation of love towards God, and his people, for his ſake, that can never be razed out, but will be increaſing and growing ſtill, according to the promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. 17. <hi>And I will pray the Father, &amp; he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> The Hypocrite is a tree that beareth fruit like as the true Chriſtian doth, but not a good tree, and therefore bringeth not forth good fruit, as the true Chriſtian doth; But the common grace of the Hypocrite, is a looſe and ſlight piece of work in the ſoule, an opinion and fancy of Faith, Joy, and Peace, like to a building on the Sand, and to a rootleſſe plant, ſtanding on his own bottome and looſe, and not engrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tree. Without any true love to Chriſt, ſenſe of ſinne, change of the heart, or any ſuch like thing, and therefore will not ſtand under any ſtorme, will not abide any Temptation.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170417:44"/> but will fall downe, dry and wither away and come to naught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may perhaps be farther objected, out of the Parable of the divers ſorts of hearers, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. That the ſame kind of grace that was in the bad hearers, was alſo in the good hearer, and differed only in degrees?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we anſwer. That the ſcope of that Parable, is only to comfort, and ſatisfy the Diſciples, as touching the fewneſſe of them that did receive the Goſpell, and profit by the Preaching thereof; And it was to lay open the various effects of the Preaching of the Goſpell, the meanes of begetting, and increaſe of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace of Gods elect, and of the common grace of the Hypocrite, by the compariſon of the Sower, and his ſowing of ſeed corne in the ground. That the effect thereof is various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ground in which it is caſt. That where the word falls into a ſtony heart, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 26. and a heart loſt in the love of the world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4, <hi>James</hi> 4 4. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 19. Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a wicked heart, there it is fruitleſſe and loſt. But where the word meets with a good and honeſt heart, which is a heart broken, and contrite for ſinne, and a heart that loveth God more then the world, of which there are few, there it doth bring forth more or leſſe fruit. So that the ſeed ſowen in all the grounds, is the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170417:45"/> ſame, but the fruit not the ſame, for the bad ground, it is ſaid of the ſeed ſowen in it, that it had no root, and that it brought forth no fruit. So that although it be the ſame word that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks the common grace in the Hypocrite, and the ſpeciall grace in the Elect, yet that which is wrought thereby in one, is not the ſame that is wrought in another hearer thereof, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 16.</p>
               <p>And now by all this that hath been ſaid it may appeare, that Sincerity lyeth more in the quality and nature, then in the quantity and meaſure of the thing. But there will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more added, we hope, for the clearing of this poynt, by a better hand, in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this book.

               <p>We have done now with the explicatory, and ſhall come next to the Applicatory part of our diſcourſe. And out of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, may we not now draw up this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. That there is great cauſe to ſuſpect, That Sincerity towards God, and Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion is rare, and that the Sincere Profeſſors thereof are few. But that Hypocriſy amongſt theſe profeſſors is very common, and that the falſe Profeſſors thereof are very many.

And then ſecondly, for the tryall of our works &amp; ſervices. 1. For the firſt. 1.

               <p>The Hypocrite as to his practiſe and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and for his outſide and appearance therein, may be viſibly changed into another man, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10. 6.

Yea ſeem more glorious, and for matter and manner both, go beyond the beſt Chriſtian, as the luſtre of falſe gold, may exceed the luſtre of true gold; and as an Artificiall picture, and painted face, may excell the naturall face; and as a Stage-player may more lively act a man, or thing ſaid or done, then the man or thing he doth act to be ſaid or done; He may therefore leave not only ſome, but all the outward evills of his life, and do in appearance all that is good, he may ſeem to deny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and live ſoberly, righteouſly and Godly, and ſo in ſhew, make a compleat out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation. He may take up the whole forme of Godlineſſe and Religion, go round from day to day, in the practiſe of piety, keep the Sabbath, Pray, heare, read, conferre, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, receive the Sacraments, Faſt and pray,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170417:47"/> and do all other duties publick and private, incumbent on a Chriſtian, he may ſeem good amongſt good, as <hi>Saul, 1 Sam:</hi> 10. 10. and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then moſt of the beſt of the time, and place as he did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 33, 34. obſerve all Gods commands, and deſire to know what is lacking, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20.

So that it is in the ſtate of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and where the Preaching of the Goſpell is, as where a man hath a corrupt ſtomack, and all the meats, the pureſt and the beſt he taketh in, do corrupt in it. And as the Sunne by his ſhining upon a ſtinking dunghill, draws forth the ſmell, and doth make the ſtink thereof to be the more, and the greater: So the fouleneſſe and corruption of ſome mens hearts is ſo great, and ſo much, that it corrupts all the pure truths of the word of God that comes in it; And the word gives occaſion to them, or rather they take occaſion

And where the preaching of the Goſpell is, there is begotten in man occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, and by accident, from the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and from the corruption of mans heart together, a Reſolution to become a Goſpell profeſſor, that is like to a falſe Conception, <hi>Phill. 1. 16. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 3. out of which at laſt there is bred and brought forth by a ſeeming act of Regeneration, a kind of changed or a new Creature, like to a falſe Birth, one like to a Chriſtian, but one that is no Chriſtian indeed.

It is ſaid to be a Birth of the fleſh, and the will of man, and not of God by his Spirit and word, as the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the true Chriſtian is. <hi>Mat. 16. 16, 17.

And this corrupt matter we ſpeak of, hath frequently a great influence upon men profeſſing Religion in their actings in publick works, that whiles they act much, and goe very farre therein, they are carried forth in it by ſome of theſe ſiniſter reſpects. So Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Churches and Commonwealths in their work of Ruling, and Preachers of the Goſpell in their work of Preaching, whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complaineth, <hi>Micah. 3: 11. The Heads judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof Divine for money: yet leane upon the Lord, &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 15. Ro. 16. 18.</hi> And it is much to be feared, that in this golden time, wherein it is with us, as it was with the Jewes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170417:59"/> in the time of <hi>Eſther. Eſther 8. 17. The Jewes had joy and gladneſſe, a feaſt, and a good day, and many of the people of the land became Jewes;</hi> For the feare of them fell upon their enemies. So now the profeſſion of the Goſpell of Chriſt is ſo much in requeſt, that the ſame is the high way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and favour. To be a zealous able Preacher of the Goſpell, or a carefull painfull Magiſtrate in the Common wealth, after the example of the greateſt men of the time, is a way to bring much furtherance to a mans ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends. And therefore it is to be doubted, that theſe ſelfe-ends and ſiniſter reſpects, may have a great influence now upon ſome of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell, That their engagement therein, may be, and is, only, or eſpecially, that they may be Rulers of Congregations, maſters of Aſſemblies, Lords over Gods Heritage, or for filthy lucres ſake, to have a livelihood, and maintenance to live by, and not to glorify God, winne the ſoules of men, feed the flock of Chriſt, and the like, the which hath been, and ought alwaies to be, the main and principall motive of the ſervants of Chriſt herein. 1 <hi>Tim: 3 3, 8. 1 Pet: 5. 2.

Now his work is, and the fruits he bringeth forth are, Love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance, which are the fruits of the Spirit; And by reflecting upon them he knoweth them. But theſe reflect acts and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Chriſts ſpirit, are not to be found in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170417:66"/> the heart of an Hypocrite, his heart is ſtill the ſame, or worſe then ever it was, as full, or more full of Pride, malice, coveteouſneſſe, and all manner of ſecret wickedneſſe, then ever it was, <hi>Mat. 23. 25, 27. within they are full of Extortion and exceſse, and of all uncleanneſſe,</hi> Acts 8. 23. <hi>thou art in the gall of bitterneſse, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 58. 2. <hi>In heart ye work wickedneſſe. &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 12. 34. Prov. 26. 24, 25, 26. And it muſt of neceſſity be ſo with him, for he hath no Faith, which doth purify the heart. <hi>Acts 15. 9. 1 Jo. 3. 3.</hi> And hence it is that the Hypocrite is ſtill called upon to repent, and waſh his heart, Eſay 1. 10. Jer. 4. 14.</p>
               <p>If it be objected that there is in the heart of an Hypocrite, ſome work of the ſpirit, much like to the work that is wrought in the heart of the true Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>To this we Anſwer. That there is ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between the common, and the ſpeciall work of the ſpirit, in the hearts of good and bad; And yet if theſe workings be well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, theſe differences may be found between them. (1.) In the heart of the true Chriſtian, as the heart it ſelf is rooted in Chriſt, So is grace by Chriſts Spirit rooted in the heart, &amp; ſprings from the ſpirituall life that is within it, which is Chriſt who dwelleth in it, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 17. That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith. Coll. 2. 7. Rooted and built up in him. &amp;c. Rom. 6. 5. For if wee

               <p>2. True grace in the heart of a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, doth flow naturally from it, as the water out of a ſpring, that will ſtill iſſue forth, and as the operations of life move in a living body, which cannot be ſtopt while the body is alive, <hi>Acts 19. 20. We cannot but ſpeak the things we have ſeen and heard, Io. 7. 38. Out of his belly ſhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water, this he ſpoke of the ſpirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive &amp;c. 1 Io 3. 3. Acts 15. 9. Phill. 2. 20. Pſal.</hi> 119. 174. and 40. 8. and 39. 3. <hi>Pro. 10. 11. 1 Pe. 2. 2</hi> But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations of that ſeeming grace which is in the heart of an Hypocrite are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and come heavily, as water drawne up by a Pumpe, bucket, or ſuch like engine, and as the motions of ſeeming life, in a dead body, made by art, after the faſhion of men and beaſts, which have been made to act, and doe like to living beaſts and men. He is as a Ciſterne that hath no water any longer then it is powred in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:170417:67"/>
               <p>3. The true grace in the heart of a true Chriſtian, is for the moſt part quick, lively, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and vigorous, as the ſpring water is, and the motions of life in the living part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are, the more it doth, the more it may move and act, <hi>Heb. 6. 10. Your labour of love, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by Faith, 1 Io. 3. 3. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifyeth himſelfe &amp;c. Jo. 7. 38, 39. 1 Pe. 1. 3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto a lively hope &amp;c.</hi> But the common work of the ſpirit in the Hypocrite is not ſo, but dull, dead, and ineffectuall. <hi>Iames 2. 20. Faith without works is dead.</hi> He is not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive within in his heart towards God, as he is without in his tongue, but his heart acts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, for this doth naturally in him work wickednes, <hi>Pſ. 58. 2. Ezek. 33. 33. With their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their coveteouſneſſe.</hi> And he doth no more in his heart, towards the things that are good, then an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall leg or tooth, to the motions of life in the body, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>4. True grace out of the heart of a true Chriſtian, doth commonly flow out abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the water out of a lively Spring, <hi>Jo. 7. 38, 39. Out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers, &amp;c.</hi> But that which is within the heart of an Hypocrite is but little, and of another kind; That therefore that the Hypocrite receiveth herein, is compared to a Taſt, that which is as by a Gargariſme in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170417:67"/> the mouth received in; but that the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian receiveth to eating and drinking, or to the vertue and ſtrength he gets: by ſtrong a Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which remaineth, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>5. The true grace in the heart of the true Chriſtian is fixed, conſtant and certaine as the Root of a tree, and doth eſtabliſh him that hath it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 9. But that which appeares in an Hypocrite, is fleeting, tranſient, and incertaine, like to a thin vapour or Cloud, <hi>Jade</hi> v: 12. <hi>Clouds they are without water, carried about with wind, Hoſea 6. 4. Your goodneſſe is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The true grace in the true Chriſtian, is commonly increaſing &amp; growing as the young tree, or child, <hi>Pſal. 84. 7. They goe from ſtrength to ſtrength. 2 Theſſ. 1. 3: Your faith groweth exceedingly. Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. But otherwiſe it is in that which is in the Hypocrite, becauſe it lacketh root, it doth not grow but wither away, <hi>Ma. 13. 6, 21. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no root they withered away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The true grace albeit it doth grow, yet it doth commonly grow leaſurely and by degrees, <hi>Heb 5. 12. Jer: 14, 9. Luke 24. 25.</hi> But that which is in the Hypocrite, is ſoon up, and groweth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. 20, 21. And in him the proverb is fulfilled, Soon ripe ſoon rotten.</p>
               <p>8. True Grace in the true Chriſtian, as it is pure in it ſelfe, ſo is it of a purifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170417:68"/> nature, it worketh out ſinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the heart. As the Spring the dirt that is within it, <hi>Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by faith, 1 Pe. 1. 22. Seeing ye have purified your ſoules, &amp;c 1 Io. 3. 3. Io</hi> 7. 38, 39. But otherwiſe it is in the heart of the Hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ite, which is ſtill as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as ever it was, <hi>Acts 8. 23 Thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe &amp;c. Mat. 23: 25, 27. Within they are full of wickedneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. The true Grace in the heart of the true Chriſtian is very powerfull, prevalent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, as a lively Spring, or flood of water, that doth carry all before it, it will make its way through all difficulties, till it hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned its end 1 <hi>Io. 5. 4. Whatſoever is borne of God overcometh the World. Ro. 8. 35, 38, 39. What ſhall ſeparate us &amp;c Ephe. 1. 19. And what is the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſſe of his power to us word who believe &amp;c. Cant: 8. 6, 7. Love is as ſtrong as death. Rom. 8. 37. We are more then conquerors &amp;c. 1 Cor. 4 20. The kingdome of God is not in word but in power, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 5. But the common work of the Spirit in the heart of an Hypocrite, hath no ſuch power or prevalency in it, but it may be eaſily interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abated by temptation or oppoſition. <hi>Mat. 13. 6, 21. Job:</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>12. And laſtly true Grace out of the heart of the true Chriſtian, doth iſſue continually without end, as a lively Spring that is ſeldome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170417:68"/> or never dry, <hi>Io: 7. 38, 39. Pſal:</hi> 1. 3. But it is otherwiſe with the common work in the heart of the Hypocrite, this like a ſtanding poole in a dry Summer, doth often faile altogether; it is therefore ſaid to be mortall and corruptible, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 23. And very often Hypocrites doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves, by a totall and finall Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>Job. 8. 13. Mat. 13. 6, 21, 22. 1 Io.</hi> 2. 9.

                  <p>The difference between the true Christian and the Hypocrite in their Outſide.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>For the firſt. The difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true and counterfeit Chriſtian, in their outſide, or by their externall works: we are to know, that the Hypocrite (As we have ſaid) may have as faire an Outſide, as the beſt Chriſtian in the World; And ſome Hypocrites are ſuch, and continue ſo to their dying day; and can ſay with that young man, <hi>Mat. 19 17, 18, 19. All theſe things have I kept from my youth up.</hi> And yet in moſt of them perhaps, if they be narrowly watched, ſome halting may be found in this alſo, as to their converſation. The true Chriſtian is altogether a Chriſtian, doth follow Chriſt fully in all things, and whether ſoever
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170417:69"/> he goes, and allwaies. And he being wrought upon ſo effectually by the word and ſpirit, as to be caſt into the mould, or transformed into the likeneſſe thereof: he is for a preſent compliance with the whole will of God in all things, he doth walke in all the commandments of God blameleſſe; He eſcheweth all that is evill, and doth all that is good, <hi>Epheſ: 4. 28. Zach. 13. 4, 5 Iſa.</hi> 1. 16, 17. He is for all duties to God, and duties to man, he is for piety, juſtice, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. And he is for Godlineſſe not only in the forme, but in the power thereof; he is for greater, for leſſer, for publick for private duties; he is for duties that are in eſteeme, and duties out of eſteeme, he is for more and for leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable duties and performances; for duties of mercy and charity, as well as for duties that have outward profits and advantages attending them, and in them all he is alike conſtant and induſtrious in their proper places. And as to all the will of God, and duty and work thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on man, he is univerſall and uniforme amongſt all perſons, in all times, places, and caſes, one and the ſame, and changeth not, but continueth ſo to his dying day, <hi>Pſal: 18. 21, 23, 24. For I have kept the waies of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. I was alſo upright before him. And I kept my ſelfe from mine iniquity, Luke</hi> 1. 6. It is ſaid of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170417:70"/> were both righteous before God, walking in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God blameleſſe. Caleb, that he did fully follow the Lord,</hi> in <hi>Deut. 1. 36. Numb.</hi> 14. 24. and 32. 11, 12. Of <hi>Auna, Luke 2 37, She ſerved God with faſtings and Prayers night and day.</hi> Of <hi>Cornelius Acts 10 2. He was a devout man and one that feared God with all his houſe, which gave much almes unto the people, and prayed to God alwaies Pſal. 101. 2. I will walk uprightly in the midst of my houſe, Acts 2. 43. And they continued steafaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine, Pſal: 101. 1, 2, 3 I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes, Epheſ: 5 1. Mat:</hi> 8. 10. and 16. 24. <hi>Jo. 4. 24. 1 Sam. 12. 3, 4. 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 2. But the Hypocrite is but almoſt, or halfe a Chriſtian, doth but ſome things and follow Chriſt in part. And he (as to this) is commonly faulty in one of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. 1. Either he will put off, and delay to doe what he is commanded. <hi>Luke 9 59. Suffer me firſt to goe and bury my Father, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Or he will doe it but by halves when he doth it, <hi>Hoſea 7. 8, 16. Numb.</hi> 32. 11. 3. Or he will doe too much, more then is given him in command by God, being led therein by his own fancy, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, or ſome humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo it is a Will worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 6. &amp;c. <hi>Why do thy Diſeiples tranſgreſſe the Traditions of the Elders &amp;c. But he anſwered why doe you alſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the commandements of God by your Tradition. For God commanded &amp;c. In vaine doe you worſhip me
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170417:70"/> teaching for Doctrines the commandements of men.</hi> So <hi>Jehu, 2 Kings 15. 1, 2. &amp;c. Luke 18. 10, 12. Pſal: 119. 81, 82. Hoſea</hi> 5. 11. 4. Or elſe (and this is more common with him) he doth too little; he doth leſſe then God commandeth, and in the reſt will doe his own will, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 7. 5. Or he is all for the duties of the firſt table, he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God religious, but towards man unjuſt, cruell, unfaithfull, &amp;c. <hi>Eſay 1. 11, 12, 13. For what purpoſe are the multitude of your ſacrifices, &amp;c. your hands are full of blood &amp;c. Mal. 2. 6. Have been partiall in the Law. Ezech:</hi> 22. 26. 6. Or he hath ſomewhat of both, but he hath a reſerve, he muſt be borne and diſpenſed with in ſome things, he hath ſome beloved ſinne or other of Profit and Pleaſure, as <hi>Naaman, 2 Kings</hi> 5. 18. the Jewes <hi>Exod. 16. 28, 29. Saul, 1 Sam: 15. 8. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Morke</hi> 6. 20. and others. 7. Or he is very exact in the leſſer, but very careleſſe in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, <hi>Mat. 23. 23. Woe to you Scribes, &amp;c. Ye pay Tithe of Mint, Annis, and Cummin, but have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the weighty matters of the Law, judgement, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Faith, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Or he is all for duties that are more publick, and not at all for private. 9. Or he is for duties that are in requeſt, and of ſelfe advantage, and for none others, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21. There is ſcarce an Hypocrite to be found, but lives in ſome known ſinne or other, and under
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170417:71"/> the power of ſome luſt which he ſerveth. He will ſerve two maſters, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6. 24. He ſuppoſeth the love of God and the world may ſtand toget her, and that he may ſerve both, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 4 The dog hath his kennell, and the Sow her ſwill. And if you mark well his ſtepps, you will finde him in time of Temptation drawn, or driven to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſome good, or doing of ſome foule evill. And to take the boldneſſe, at leaſt at ſome time, or in ſome places, or amongſt ſome company, or in ſome caſe to offend wickedly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 30, 31. compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10. 10. and 14. 33, 34. <hi>Mark. 6 20, 21, 22, 27. 2 Kings 5. 18.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170417:71"/> that there are between the ſaving, and reall Graces of the true Chriſtian, and the counterfeit Graces of the Hypocrite in ſome particulars.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>1. In their Knowledge.</head>
                  <p>The true Chriſtian hath, and muſt have the knowledge of God, for without this, the heart cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. And ſo the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may have, and hath alſo. But there are theſe differences between the knowledge of the one, and the knowledge of the other. 1. The knowledge of the true Chriſtian is commonly a more clerae, and diſtinct knowledge, <hi>Phill. 1. 9, 10. Mat:</hi> 13. 11. But that of the Hypocrite a more generall, confuſed, and obſcure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and ſuch was the knowledge of the Scribes and Phariſees of the Scripture. 2. That of the true Chriſtian is more certain, as being grounded upon the Scripture, and alſo upon ſome practiſe, and experience of the things known. And it is like to the knowledge that a man hath of meats, drinks, and medicines, by the view, taſt, and trial over and beſides his reading of them. And to the knowledge that a man hath of a Country, that he hath dwelt, walked in, and beheld with his own eyes, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his knowledge thereof by the Mappe, <hi>Phill. 1. 9, 10. Heb: 5. 14. Pſal: 34. 8. 1 Pet:</hi> 2. 3. But that of the Hypocrite is only ſpeculative and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170417:72"/> diſcourſive, like to the knowledge that a man hath of a farre Country by a Mappe, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it; or to the knowledge that a man hath of the vertues of meats, &amp; medicines, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof only, <hi>Mat. 23. 16. 17. Jo: 3. 10. Acts 22. 3. Phill.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. 3. That of the true Chriſtian, is alwaies accompanied with a deſire and labour of increaſe thereof, and the more he hath, the more he deſireth and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have ſtill, <hi>Phill. 1. 9, 10.

               </p>
               <p>8 And it is a love that is like to the love of a dear Wife to her loving Husband, or the love of a contracted Virgin, betrothed to her lover a young man, where the love is exceeding ſtrong, and doth manifeſt it ſelf by ſuch like effects as theſe.</p>

               <p>But the love of Chriſt that is in the heart of the Hypocrite, it is not ſuch a love; it is not ſo rooted and grounded in Chriſt, or in the heart, and therefore fadeth and dyeth in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; nor doth it ariſe from the love of Chriſt to him, and the view of Chriſts loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170417:81"/> it hath to do any good offices it can doe for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is as tender of others as it is of its own good; it rejoyceth at the good, and not at the hurt of another, and it ſpends itſelf, and is ſpent for the good of others. <hi>It envieth not</hi> (i.) It is very well pleaſed at, and contented with the happineſs of others, and doth not grudge it. <hi>It vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up</hi> (i.) It keepeth the man from vain oſtentation, inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſcornful thoughts againſt, and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards others. <hi>Doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly</hi> (i.) It will not diſgrace another, nor ſuffer him that hath it to uſe unſeemly words or geſture towards another. <hi>Seeketh not her own</hi> (i.)

It will diſſemble injuries, and ſwallow down wrongs; it is ſlow to wrath, and not quickly angry, what cauſe ſoever be given.

It hopeth the beſt where there is no apparent reaſon to the contrary. It hopeth all the good it can hope, and that which cannot be well beloved. And it doth never ſo far deſpair, as not to uſe means. <hi>Endureth all things</hi> (i.) It will bear the greateſt, rather than doe the leaſt injury: it will bear all things it may bear with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: it will ſuffer much evil it ſelf, to doe a little good to others.</p>
               <p>But otherwiſe it is in this particular alſo in the heart of an Hypocrite: For either he doth hate, envy, or contemn the true Chriſtian (and this is moſt common) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 7.

               <p>The true Chriſtian doth love the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 13. And ſo he muſt. But the Hypocrite hath a kind of love to the Word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo The differences lye in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The true love of the true Chriſtian ariſeth from his love to God and Chriſt, whoſe Word it is, and from the excellency of it, as having
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170417:83"/> his likeneſs upon it, <hi>Pſal. 119. 129. Thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are wonderful, therefore doth my ſoul keep them,</hi> Pſal. 19. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is a natural love, ariſing from the new creature within him, as he is a new born childe of God, and hath a new life, whence ariſeth hunger and thirſt to this Word, the proper food apointed of God to feed it, and maintain the life thereof, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new born babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is a pure love, he loveth it for it ſelf, and for the puritie and perfection of it, <hi>Rom. 7. 12. 22. Pſal. 19. 7. The Law of God is perfect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is a vehement love, as that of a childe to the mothers breaſt; he hath an high eſteem of the Word, a ſtrong deſire after it, cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, no more than the childe without the breaſt, and will not part with it for the whole world, 2 Pet 2. 2.

               <p n="6">6 It is a fruitfull, changing, and efficacious love: it makes the man in whom it is by the uſe of this VVord to grow ſtill, and be changed into the very likeneſs of it; and ſo to love the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170417:83"/> knowledge of it, as to fall into the practiſe, and obedience of it. He loves to do it, as well as to know it, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>As new born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. <hi>But ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine.</hi> Job 23. 12. <hi>Neither have I gone back from the commandement of his lips,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 22. But the falſe love, and ſo the ſhort and ſleight delight of the Hypocrite to and in this VVord, hath none of all this; for it is commonly to a part of it onely; he cannot brook that part thereof that ſhall diſcover and correct his ſin, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially his ſecret and beloved ſin, <hi>John 3. 20, 21. Mark 6. 17, 18. 3 Luk. 19 20. 2 Chron.</hi> 18. 7.

               <p>The true Chriſtian is ſuch a one as doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and ſo he muſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. But the Hypocrite (as we have ſhewed) may believe in Chriſt alſo, <hi>John</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 8 13. But there is a vaſt difference between the faith of the true, and the faith of the falſe Chriſtian herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The one, the unfeigned faith of the true Chriſtian is a grace of the Regenerating Spirit, and alwaies accompanied with Regeneration, John 1. 12, 13. <hi>But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to them which beleeve in his Name, which was born not of blood,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 2. 8. Gal. 5. 22. John 3. 5.</p>

               <p n="4">4 It is a faith whereby a man takes Chriſt to him, and gives himſelf up to Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 11. 13. Having ſeen the promiſes afar off,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and embraced them,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 3. 12. John 5. 24. and 6. 37, 38. Rom. 12. 1.</p>

               <p n="6">6 It is a ſoul-purifying faith, Acts 15. 9 <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their hearts by faith,</hi> &amp;c. and 26. 18.

               <p n="7">7 It is a ſoul-conflicting Faith, it hath many doubts, fears, and difficulties to encounter with, Mark 9. 24. <hi>And ſtratway the father of the child cried out, and ſaid with tears, Lord I beleeve, help thou mine unbelief.</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Work out your own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 It is an obedient-making faith: it makes a man ſincerely obedient, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 7. 8. 17. and fruitfull in good works, Gal 5. 6. <hi>But faith which worketh by love.</hi> Tit. 3. 8. Heb. 11 throughout. James 2. 17, 20. and ready and chearful therein, Gal. 5. 7</p>

               </p>
               <p>But the faith of the Hypocrite is a groundleſs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170417:87"/> faith, that for which he hath no promiſe; it is either Hiſtorical onely, as was that of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> Acts 26. 27. and of the devils, James 2. 19. that he doth beleeve the things written in the VVord to be true. <hi>The devils beleeve and tremble.</hi> Or that of miracles, which <hi>Judas</hi> and others had, by which they did miraculous and wonderfull things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 22, 23.

And this indeed is preſumption. Or it is a temporary faith, which doth uſually vaniſh like a Comet in time of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and he that hath it falls away by Apoſtaſie, Luke 8. 13. with Mat. 13. 20, 21.

               </argument>
               <p>The true Chriſtian muſt be convinced of his ſin, inwardly grieved and humbled for his ſin,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170417:88"/> and this before and after his calling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and muſt be changed and converted in heart and life from it, <hi>Luke 13. 3. Acts 17. 30. Acts 11. 18. Iſa.</hi> 1. 11. to 29. <hi>Tit. 1. 15. Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. Wee find alſo that there is a kind of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that there are gripings and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the heart, and ſome effects thereof in the life of the Hypocrite, <hi>Mat. 27. 3. Pſal.</hi> 68. 35, 36. But there is between the one and the other a great difference.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the firſt converſion and repentance for ſin in general.</p>
               <p>And 2 in particular converſions upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular falls.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt: That of the true Chriſtian is wrought by the VVord of God with the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit, diſcovering to him his ſin and danger thereby, Acts 2. 37, 38. Jer. 31. 19. <hi>After that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh.</hi> But the repentance of the Hypocrite may ariſe out of the working of his natural conſcience, and the fear of eternal vengeance, which he may have ſo much faith to beleeve will light upon ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the ordinary way of Gods working on the heart in true Repentance: Hee firſt of all convinces of the ſinfulneſs and danger of ſin, and then wounds the heart, as <hi>John 16. 18, 19. Acts 26. 18. Ezek. 36. 31. Hoſea 2. 6, 7. Acts 2. 37. Luke</hi> 15. 17, 18, 19. And by this, as by a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170417:88"/> makes way for repentance and converſion, and a coming to Chriſt; ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. where <hi>Peter</hi> adviſeth the Iews then pricked in their hearts to repent, compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. And ſo being in Chriſt, there is a true turning to God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 16. and 2. 5. and 3. 5. But the conviction and ſorrow of the Hypocrite is without any turning to Chriſt, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> Mat. 27. 3 or to God in Chriſt; either he goeth to the devil, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 28. or wicked men, with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> Mat: 7. 2, 4. or to the creature, or from one ſin to another; he returneth not to the Lord; his returning is therefore compared to a cake half baked, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 8, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſorrow of the true Chriſtian is a deep and thorough ſorrow, <hi>Zach. 12. 10, 11, 12. And they ſhall mourn as one for his only ſon,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 26. 75. <hi>He wept bitterly,</hi> Ier. 31. 18, 19. Ezek. 33. 10. But that of the Hypocrite is a ſudden flaſh, or ſleight qualm of grief only, <hi>Pſ. 78. 36. 1 Kings</hi> 21 29.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The ſorrow of the true Chriſtian is a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſorrow, it laſteth as long as his ſin laſteth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 3. and 42. 5. <hi>Rom. 7 24 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 10. But that which is in the heart of the Hypocrite is a ſhort &amp; tranſient ſorrow, like to the fit of an Ague or Sea ſickneſs, <hi>Hoſea 7. 14. They have not cried to mee with their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 The ſorrow of the true Chriſtian is for all ſin alike, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 5. 14. But that of the Hypocrite
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170417:89"/> is commonly for ſome ſpeciall ſin that hath (as he ſuppoſeth) brought, or may bring ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial evil upon him; ſo <hi>Iudas,</hi> Mat. 27. 3, 4.</p>

               <p>The true Chriſtian doth, may, and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and delight in God and Chriſt, and in the things of God, 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 9. 17. Pſal.</hi> 119. 47. But the Hypocrite hath alſo ſome delight and joy in God, and in his Word, &amp;c. But there is a great difference between this affection in the one, and in the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The true Chriſtian doth rejoice and delight in God and Chriſt, and the matters of God for themſelves, and the goodneſs and holineſs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, &amp;c. and 84. 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. But the Hypocrite doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God at all, Iob 27. 10. <hi>Will he delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Almighty?</hi> Or if his delight be in the Word of God, it is for ſome good it ſeems to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170417:91"/> hold forth, or that he apprehends in it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The delight and ſweetneſs that is wrought in the heart of the true Chriſtian ariſeth from an inward principle, or new nature that is within him, which was formed by the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Pſ</hi> 110. 3. But there is none of this in the Hypocrite; for he is without the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. and he was never chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The joy and delight of the true Chriſtian is a deep, large, and tranſcendent joy, <hi>Pſ 119. 14. 72. Phil. 4 7. It paſseth all underſtanding.</hi> Pſ. 71. 23. Pſal. 4 7. But the joy of the Hypocrite is but a ſhallow, ſleight, and ſuperficiall joy, compared to the taſte of a thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. He hath much more joy and delight in his juſt, as <hi>Iudas</hi> in his covetouſneſs, and <hi>Herod</hi> in his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> than in God, and the things of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The joy of a true Chriſtian is a clear and pure joy, and there is no ſorrow in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22, But the joy of the Hypocrite is an obſcure and mixed joy, Prov. 14. 13. <hi>Even in laughter their heart is ſorrowful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is in the upright accompanied with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow that goeth before, or with it, <hi>Pſal. 2. 11. Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. But all the joy that is in the heart of the temporary is without this, as in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170417:92"/> 
                  <hi>Herod, Mark 6. 20. Ezek. 33. 32. Mat.</hi> 13. 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The joy of the upright man grows up by grees and leiſurely, <hi>Acts 2 37. 38, 46. Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. But the Hypocrites joy is up and very high upon a ſuddain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 20.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The joy of a ſincere man is a laſting and permanent joy, <hi>Iſa. 35. 10. Pſal.</hi> 35 10. But the joy of the Hypocrite is but for a moment, it is ſoon up and ſoon down, <hi>Job 20. 5. Mat. 13. 20, 21. Pſal. 106. 12. 13. Then beleeved they his words, they ſang his praiſe, they ſoon forgat his works.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8 There is ſtrength in the joy of the ſincere man, <hi>Neh</hi> 8. 10. For it will help him to bear his croſs, <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2. Pſal. 119 92. Phil.</hi> 4. 7. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is of the Hypocrites joy, for when tribulation comes, he falls off, and hath no ſtrength to bear it, <hi>Mat 13. 21. Luke</hi> 8. 31.</p>
               <p n="9">9 It will make him that is ſincere more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and active for God whiles he is on his feet, and when he falls it will help to recover him, <hi>Luke 1. 74, 78, 79. Acts 9. 18, 19, 20. Pſal. 119. 32, 93. Pſal.</hi> 77. 6.</p>

But there is a great deal of odds in the frame and diſpoſition of their hearts therein, both in the firſt undertaking, and in their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acting, and that in the leaving or omiſſion of evil, and in the doing of good, and their motives and ends therein: The true Chriſtian in his firſt undertaking of the profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doth deſign and aim at an univerſal and compleat obedience &amp; conformity to the whole will of God, to keep all his Commandments, <hi>Pſ. 101. 1, 2 3, &amp;c. 119. 6. When I have reſpect to all thy Commandements.</hi> Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We trust we have a good conſcience in all things, willing to live honeſtly.</hi> Acts 24. 16. But the deſign of the Hypocrite is to go ſo far and doe ſo much therein as may ſerve to his own end, which is not to pleaſe and glorifie God, but to pleaſe and advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And hence it is that it doth ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170417:94"/> to doe the good he ought to do, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbear to do the evil he ought not to do, ſometimes doe the good he ought to doe, <hi>Mat. 14. 5. Mark 12. 12. Luke</hi> 20. 19. and 22. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22. And in his further acting in what he doth, and in what he forbeareth to doe. All that the Hypocrite doth think of in the forbearance of, or flying from evil, is to forbear it for his own end therein. But the true Chriſtian therein is moved from the fear of God, <hi>Gen. 39. 9. Prov.</hi> 14. 1. and the hatred of ſin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 4. And all that he doth think of in doing of good, is the work to be done, as in Praier, only to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the true Chriſtian is carefull of the manner and order of his doing, of the diſpoſition of his heart, and his aim and ends therein. That in it he be carried out from the conſcience of the command of God, and his obedience thereunto; his love to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 14. That hee be ſwayed more therein by the fear of God than the fear of men, and with deſire to pleaſe God rather than to pleaſe men, and that he take more care to fulfill the will of God than of men, Gal. 1. 10 <hi>Nor do I ſeek to pleaſe men,</hi> &amp;c.

Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample with this acknowledgement of ſin, there
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170417:94"/> is joyned a heart broken for ſin, hating it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving againſt it, and faith in the blood of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 10. Pſal. 51. 4. Luke 18. 10. Dan. 7. 7, 8, 9. Ezra 10. 2. Mark</hi> 1. 15. And he hath an end beyond himſelf, and the ſaving of his ſoul. To pleaſe God, to doe it to the Lord, for Gods ſake, as well for his own ſake, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and glory of the name of God and Chriſt, as well as for the good of his own ſoul, Phil. 1. 21. <hi>For me to live is Chriſt</hi> (that is) Chriſt is both the author and end of my life: I live for him, I live in him, I live by him, I live to him, or all the gain that I aim at in life or death is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, Acts 20. 24. and 21. 13. <hi>I am ready to dye for the name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> Mat. 6. 9, 13. <hi>Rom. 9. 3. Lam.</hi> 2. 18. But otherwiſe it is in the heart of the Hypocrite in all that hee doth of good, and forbeareth to do of evil. It is for his own end. He leaves his ſin, but loves it ſtil. He hath not left it for love of God, poſſibly he may leave it for ſome fear of God and his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or fear of men, as Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Parents, and the like, and fear of ſome harme that may come to him by them; for he hath a ſlaviſh fear, <hi>Gen. 28. 8.

Rom. 1. 25. <hi>Served the creature more than the creator,</hi> &amp;c. That doe all for <hi>reward,</hi> Jude 11. Mic. 3. 11. 2 Pet. 2. 3. <hi>through covetouſneſſe ſhall with feigned words</hi> make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of the ſoules of men, Acts 20. 30. And ſo he may forbear to doe the evil that otherwiſe he would doe, and doe the good that otherwiſe he would not do. So the Scribes and Phariſees did faſt and pray to get praiſe and wealth, <hi>Mat. 6 2. 16. Mat. 23, 14, 15. Zach. 7. 5. Did ye faſt unto me,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170417:95"/> even to me, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſea 7. 14, 15. <hi>And they have not cried unto me with their heart; they aſſemble themſelves for corn and wine,</hi> &amp;c. and 10. 1. <hi>He bringeth forth fruir to himſelf.</hi> Sometimes the fear of man keeps him from the doing of evil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 5. and 21. 46. Sometimes this alſo may provoke him to ſome good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 8. And as there is a great deal of difference in their minds as to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo there is as to their ſufferings alſo for Chriſt. The true Chriſtian muſt ſuffer for Chriſt, and muſt be ready, and will be able to leave all for him. The Hyocrite alſo may, and ſomtimes doth ſuffer many things for Chriſt. But the one of them hath firſt learned to deny himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he take up his croſs; the other takes up his croſs before that he hath learned to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The one doth ſuffer out of love to Chriſt for Righteouſneſs and the Goſpels ſake, for the glory of Chriſt, and advantage of Chriſtians; The other out of a ſelf-love, for his own ſake, as for his own glory and praiſe, or for ſome earthly advantage to himſelf. So <hi>Judas</hi> ſuffered with the reſt for Chriſt, to fill his purſe, and to be great in Chriſts kingdom, which hee thought would be an earthly kingdom, 1 Cor. 13. 3. <hi>And though I give my body to be burned, and have not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Pſal. 44. 22. 2 Tim. 2 10. Mark 10. 28, 29. Gal. 3. 4. Jerem. 15. 15. Mat. 10. 39. and 16. 25.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:170417:96"/>
               <p>And thus much for the differences between them in their outſide and inſide conſidered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. It remains now that we lay down ſome few differences that there are between them in their outſide and inſide conſidered together.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>The Hypocrite is naturally a ſinner, and ſo is the true Chriſtian, <hi>There is no man good, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3. 10. And they both ſin; for <hi>there is no man liveth and ſinneth not.</hi> 1 Kings 8. 46. <hi>And in many things we offend all,</hi> James 3. 2. <hi>And if we ſay wee have no ſin we make him a lyar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John 1. 8, 10. Pſal. 19. 12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> Pſal. 38. 4. and 40. 12. and 65. 3. and 130. 3. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The true Chriſtian hath in him originally the ſame pravitie and corruption of nature that the Hypocrite hath, and by nature they are both alike ſinfull, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The true Chriſtian hath after his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomewhat of the corruption of his nature ſtill remaining in him. And therefore there is ſtill in him ſome propenſitie and inclination to all ſin, and a poſſibilitie of his falling into any ſin but the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; there is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170417:96"/> ſtill fleſh and ſpirit in him, <hi>Rom. 7. 15, 16, 17. Gal.</hi> 5. 17, 18. James 1. 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He may be ſomewhat tainted and touched with any of the ſins of the time and place, as were the true Chriſtians and members of the beſt Churches in all times more or leſs, which is to be perceived by the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This corruption may ſomtimes in the heart boyl up &amp; break out to ſom height in the inward motions and luſts thereof, as in uncleanneſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, pride, and the like; as in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2, 3. in <hi>Aſa.</hi> 2 Chr. 14. 1, 2 compared with 16. 1, 2, 3. 7. 10. <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. and others.</p>
               <p n="5">5 For the leſſer ſins of Infirmity, theſe hee may commit daily all his life long, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15.</p>
               <p n="6">6 He may occaſionally fall into foul &amp; ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins, Murder, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, and the like, as <hi>Noah, Peter, David, Lot,</hi> and others did, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 11. 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>Gen. 9. 24. Gen.</hi> 19. 32, 33. But for this ſee more in chap. 8. at the beginning of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 There may be very much of the will going along with his commitment of theſe ſins for the preſent time, as in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Theſe acts of ſin may by him be repeated again and again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 33. 34, 35.</p>
               <p n="9">9 He may after his commiſſion thereof reſt and continue ſecure therein for a while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170417:97"/> repentance, as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>In all theſe things there is little or no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be found in outward appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Chriſtian, and the Hypocrite, but that for a time they may be alike. And yet there is an vaſt, an real difference to be found between the Hypocrite and the true Chriſtian herein alſo as to their committing of, and continuance in their ſin; and that before the ſin done; 2 In the commiſſion of the ſin; 3 After the ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: For he that is born of God cannot, may not ſo ſin as the Hypocrite can and may do, 1 Joh. 5. 18. Deut. 32. 5. <hi>Their ſpot is not the ſpot of his children,</hi> &amp;c. And there are to be found theſe differences between the ſin of the one and of the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Before the ſin committed the ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth generally hate all ſin, for the evill that is in it, as well as for the evil conſequences of it: And he hates it in all men, more in thoſe that are near about him, moſt of all in himſelf, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 16. Pſ</hi> 101 1, 2, 3. He looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſin as a filthineſs, and flies it; he hath a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution againſt it, yea he cannot love or delight in it; there being as great a contrarietie between him and it, as between light and darkneſs. And it is againſt his new nature, as it is contrary to the nature of a ſheep to wallow in the dirt. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though happily this hatred in the very act of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170417:97"/> commiſſion of the ſin may be ſuſpended, hee is like a neat huſwife in a kitchin, that doth keep her not onely from the fire, hut from the filth and ſoyl of the place. He doth not ſeek ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 128. I <hi>hate every falſe way.</hi> Rom. 7. 15. <hi>But what I hate that I doe.</hi> Pſal. 119. 57. <hi>I have ſaid I will keep thy words.</hi> Pſal. 19. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Cleanſe me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>keep hack thy ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 97. 10. Prov. 8: 13. But the Hypocrite doth not hate ſin; for if hee did, he would hate all as well as ſome ſin. But he doth naturally love and delight in ſin, and in his own ſin, which comes from a natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple thereof within him, <hi>Job 20. 12, 13. Though wihkedneſs be ſweet in his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Yea he loveth the ſin he hath left, and dareth not to commit it for ſome inconveniencies onely that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it to him, Pſal. 36. 4. <hi>He abhorreth not evii.</hi> Hoſea 127. <hi>He is a Merchart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He ſetteth himſelf in a way that is not good.</hi> Pſal. 2. 3. It ſuteth wel with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature &amp; impure heart. It is with him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as with a ſluttiſh Cook-maid, who doth not care to keep her ſelf from the ſoyl and filth, but from the fire of the kitchin. So if the Hypocrite
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170417:98"/> can keep himſelf from the fire of hell, he cares not to be kept from the filth of ſin. He hath (and this is the beſt of his caſe) ſome deſire to be clean and cleanſed of ſin, as it is neceſſary to ſave him from the fire of hell, and carry him to heaven, and no further. And for theſe things ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 7. Rom. 1. 32. 2 Pet. 2. 15. 22. Pſal 50 16, 17. <hi>They hate to be reformed.</hi> 2 He doth watch and pray againſt it, <hi>Pſal. 9. 12, 13. Mat. 6. 13. Job</hi> 31. 1, 2. But ſo doth not the Hypocrite, but rather watch an opportunity to commit it, being that which he deſireth, delighteth, and purpoſeth to doe, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 21, 2 In the ſin committed. 1 It is againſt the main bent, purpoſe, and reſolution of the heart of a true Chriſtian to ſin; for his firm purpoſe is to follow God fully, and to doe his whole will, and he doth ſtrengthen himſelfe here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n. He doth not contrive and forecaſt to ſin, but when he doth ſo, he is (for the moſt part) ſurprized therein. Pſal. 119. 33, 117, 106. <hi>I have ſworn and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgements,</hi> Pſal. 17. 3. <hi>I am purpoſed that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſr.</hi> James 3. 2.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170417:98"/> keeps a Method in his ſin, his plot is to ſin, but to ſin ſo ſecretly as it may not be known. His ſin is premeditated, and (as we ſay) in coole blood: he watcheth his time for it; and that he doth herein is with the full conſent of his will.

They yeeld themſelves as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the ſervice of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. and ſell themſelves, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> to do wickedly 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 25. 2 The true Chriſtian doth very rarely fall into groſſe ſin; but ſome Hypocrites ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, that they make it, as it were their trade, to doe wickedly, and by a cuſtomary acting of it, have gotten ſuch a cuſtomary habit thereof, that they cannot leave, Jer. 9. 5. <hi>They have taught their tongue to ſpeak lies, and wearted themſelves to commit iniquitie.</hi> Jer. 13. 23. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, &amp;c. then may ye alſo doe good that are accuſtomed to doe evil.</hi> But the true Chriſtian doth for the moſt part keep himſelf unſpotted from the ſins of the times; he doth as the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, albeit he meet with dirt in his way, yet doth he as much as much as he may keep from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it; ſo the true Chriſtian as much as he can keeps himſelf from being ſolved by the ſins of the time and place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. 3 The
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170417:99"/> true Chriſtian doth not ſin ſo univerſally as the Hypocrite doth. The true Chriſtian doth not act ſin with all the faculties and powers of his ſoul and body as the Hypocrite doth, but there is ſome reluctancy in the heart therein. There is in him fleſh and ſpirit, a regenerate and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, Rom. 7. 18, 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God in the inward man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that which I do I allow not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the evil I have that doe I,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. Pſal. 32. 2. Nor doth the true Chriſtian, or he is not ready to commit all ſorts of ſin, and at all times and alwaies as the Hypocrite is, who maketh it his trade to ſin. Pſal. 50. 19. <hi>Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit, thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt,</hi> &amp;c. And therfore he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be as skilful in it as he can, Jer. 9. 5. <hi>They have taught their tongues to ſpeak lyes.</hi> And he giveth up himſelf wholly to it, and to act all kinde of ſin, as a man of a trade doth give himſelfe up to his trade, to doe all that belongs to it, and to doe it alwaies. Now he that is born of God cannot thus ſin. Joh. 3. 9. It is not his ordinary practiſe ſo to ſin; but if happily he fall into a ſin, he doth not often; his ſin is occaſional, like to the true mans going out of the highway, who comes in again preſently, and like a river that is turned out of its channel by ſome ſtop or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which will get in again as ſoon as it can. He doth not go in the way of Gods commandments
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170417:99"/> as the Hypocrite doth; for hee like as the thiefe comes in the true mans way, for the preſent to ſerve his turn, and to doe miſchief onely; elſe he keeps by-waies and obſcure places. Nor doth the true Chriſtian give and yeeld up himſelf to the ſervice of ſinne, as a ſervant to his maſters work, Rom. 6. 16. but as a priſoner is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it againſt his will, he yeeldeth himſelf for the preſent, as being unable to prevent it, Rom. 7. 23, 24. <hi>But I ſee another law in my members, bringing me into eaptivitie,</hi> &amp;c. Nor doth the true Chriſtian, or can he fall totally and finally, <hi>Mat. 24. 24. deceive if poſſibly the very elect,</hi> as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may doe, and oftentimes doth. The true Chriſtian is like to the good tree, that doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily bring forth good fruit, which yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily may by ſome accidents faile ſome years; or he is as a man of healthy conſtitution that fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once, or more than once into a fit of ſicknes, but otherwiſe is healthy alwaies. But the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite he is iike to one that hath one of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, his liver or his lungs corrupted and rotten, he is alwaias, and all over ſick. And ſin in the ſincere Chriſtian is in ſome of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects fitly compared by ſome to the dirt in a lively pure ſpring, that will not ſuffer it to bee quiet, bvt will be working it out. But it is in the Hypocrite as in the ſtanding pool that gathereth the mud, and keeps in when it hath it; or as it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170417:100"/> is in a bad ſtomack that loves, devoureth, and feedeth upon traſh, and retains it to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, but a good ſtomack will not endure it, but caſt it out one way or other; or if it continue till it corrupt the body, it puſheth out the corruption by boyls and the like; ſo the good ſoul cannot, wil not endure ſin long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it in peace. 4 After the ſin committed, i. The true Chriſtian having ſinned doth not reſt ſecure in his ſin, hee doth not allow or approve of what he hath done, much leſs doth he juſtifie or defend, leeſt of all doth he glory in it, as the Hypocrite doth: but finding himſelf to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and wounded by it, hee labours with all ſpeed to be cleanſed and cured. He is therfore diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and grieved for it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of it, is afraid of Gods diſpleaſure by it, as a child of the diſpleaſure of a father when he hath done a fault; and therefore he is glad of any help herein for his cure: For the ſin of the true Chriſtian to him, is as the cruel ſervice of the Iſraelites under their cruell Taskmaſters in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was to them. Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me,</hi> &amp;c. Or as a man that being fallen into the fire, and like to bee burnt, is ſnatcht out of the ſame, and ſo eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the danger; ſo the true Chriſtian he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confeſs, and willing to forſake his ſin, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13. And doth forſake it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:170417:100"/> 4. 2. And afterwards make amends to God and man what he can for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 18. and <hi>Zacheus ſtood up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Peter,</hi> Mat 26. 70, 72, 75.</p>
               <p>For ordinary and daily frailties, the true Chriſtian doth mourn for them daily, as hee doth commit and obſerve them, Pſal. 19. 12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? cleanſe thou me,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 7. 22. If he fall into greater ſins, hee is more deeply humbled for them, and doth more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neutly repent thereof, as <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26 75. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 2 Sam. 24, 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 40. 1, 4, 5, &amp;c. But otherwiſe it is with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in all theſe particulars. Hee is pleaſed with his ſin, and not troubled with it, but when it brings him into trouble. Otherwiſe hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue in his ſin, and his ſin in him, Pſal: 36. 2, 3. <hi>He flattereth himſelf in his own eyes till his iniquitie be found to be hatefull:</hi> Takes a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial contentment in it, is never better but when he is acting of it. And he is ſecure in it, and as one that is faſt aſleep cannot endure to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo hee cannot endure to be told of his ſin, to be troubled about it: For he ſtiffens himſelf in it, is reſolved becauſe it ſerves his turn, and ſutes with his diſpoſition that he will not leave it, and therefore doth deny, excuſe, defend, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, or perhaps glory in it. Pſal. 36. 4. Phil. 3. 19. <hi>Whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame.</hi> Hoſea 12. 7, 8. Rom. 2. 32.</p>

Pſ. 119. 29. <hi>Remove from me the way of lying,</hi> &amp;c. (that is) let me no more not diſſemble with God and Man as I have done, but let me be ſincere according to thy Law. But there is no ſuch thing in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, the more he doth, the more he may ſin, and groweth worſe and worſe.

               <p n="3">3 The true Grace is a pure and incorruptible Grace, and therefore an enduring, increaſing, and immortal Grace, 2 Theſ. 1. 3. <hi>Your faith groweth exceedingly.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 118.

               <argument>
                  <p>In their new obedience in the general, and the exactneſs and compleatneſs thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The ſincerre Chriſtian, as he is a new creature, ſo he is to yeeld and perform a new obedience to God in Chriſt, in his doing and ſuffering of the will of God, according to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom. 16. 19. 26. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Rom.</hi> 6. 17. The Hypocrite he doth ſomewhat like unto this; for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit ſeems to be caſt out of him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 13. But there is a vaſt difference between them herein alſo. 1 In the perſon doing. 2 In the thing done. 1 In the perſon doing. The ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian looks to it, that he himſelf be rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the work, that he himſelf be good and accepted of God, that he be in Chriſt by faith, &amp; ſo a new creature, otherwiſe his works cannot be accepted. <hi>Deut. 33. 10, 11. Gen. 4. 4, 5. God had reſpect to Abel and his offering,</hi> &amp;c. But the hypocrite hath no regard of this, but being ſtil in his ſins, &amp; without the wedding garment of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon him, his work is not accepted, <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> Joh 9. 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 11, 12. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 9. 2 In the thing done. The obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian flows from the true and right principle, <hi>viz</hi> the new nature from his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 11. But the the obedience of the Hypocrite floweth from corrupt principles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:170417:103"/>
               <p>2 The new obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian is regular and orderly. He is firſt taught, and commanded, he heareth what he is to beleeve and doe, and then hee is obedient to it. <hi>Jer. 31. 19. After that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon the thigh,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 9. 6. and 16. 30. and 2. 37, 38. <hi>Iſa. 2. 2. Epheſ. 1. 13. In whom ye truſted after that ye heard the word,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 10. 14, 15. But the obedience of the Hypocrite is oft times a blind and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obedience not grounded upon, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Word of God, but upon his own, or ſome other mans fancy and opinion. Rom. 10. 1, 2. <hi>They have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 He doth it knowingly and beleevingly; he not onely hath a word for what he beleeveth, and doth, but he knoweth he hath ſuch a word for it, and ſo doth it in faith, which the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite heedeth little, and therefore is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Heb. 11. 4, 6. Acts 17. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The new obedience of the ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is an exact and compleat obedience; 1 it is univerſal. He is holy in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yeelds himſelf to do and ſuffer all that God will have him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. But that of the Hypocrite is lame and defective. And the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſincere Chriſtian it is univerſal.</p>
               <p>1 As to the things to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>2 It is entire, as to the man that doth obey
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170417:103"/> As to the firſt; the Hypocrite he is lame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in this. His obedience is but by halves, or in part onely, as <hi>Jehu, Saul,</hi> and others, Mal. 2. 9. <hi>And have been partial in my Law.</hi> Hoſea 7. 8. <hi>Ephraim is a cake not turned.</hi> He doth as <hi>Herod,</hi> Mark 6. 20. <hi>did many things,</hi> not all that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But the true Chriſtian, he is through paced in his goings herein, as were <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua, who followed the Lord fully,</hi> Numb. 14. 24. and 32. 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 36. and <hi>David, who had reſpect to all Gods commandements.</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. and <hi>Paul, who had a conſcience voyd of offence towards God, and towards man,</hi> Acts 24. 16. and <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, who walked in all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1. 6. But more particularly. The ſincere Chriſtian he ceaſeth from doing all that is evil, and he doth all that is good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 6. The Hypocrite, he doth not ceaſe from all that is evil; for either he is erroneous in his opinion, as thoſe in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>Jude</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. or in his practiſe, or in both. Or (at the moſt and at the beſt) he doth depart from evil onely in his outſide, his heart is where it was ſtill, pſal. 58. 2. <hi>Yea in heart ye work wickedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 52. 3. And ſome evill or other hee doth moſt commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his life ſtill, as <hi>Judas</hi> he kept his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs ſtill, <hi>Joh. 12. 6. Herod</hi> he kept his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife ſtill, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 18. 20. <hi>Iehu</hi> whiles hee boaſts ſo much of the zeal he had for the Lord,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170417:104"/> and the uprightneſs of his heart therein, <hi>depart not from the ſins of Iereboam which made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> 2 Kings 10. 15, 31. <hi>Saul</hi> whiles he pretends ſo much tenderneſs of conſcience in ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet carrieth ſtill within him his murdrous intentent to kill <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 33, 44. and 18. 10. and 20. 5. Exod. 16. 28, 29 2 Kings 5. 18. Zephan. 1. 5. Hoſea 7. 7, 8, 9, 10. Iſaiah 65. 3, 4, 5, 6. But the ſincere Chriſtian hee leaves all that is evil, in opinion, in practiſe, in heart, in life. The ſin of his love and delight, inclination, age, temper, and conſtitution, profit, trade, office, calling; that which he is moſt tempted to, his open, his ſecret, his greater and his leſſer ſinnes. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 128. <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> and 101. 3. <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes.</hi> and 119. 101. I <hi>have refrained my feet from every evil way.</hi> and 18. 23. <hi>I kept my ſelf from mine intiquitie</hi> Pſal, 19. 12. <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> from the ſin of his inclination, he would not look on a maid; of his calling, as a Magiſtrate, he deſpiſed not the cauſe of the meaneſt; of his condition, as a rich man, hee would not oppreſs the poor; he kept from the ſin of his affection, occaſion, and profit, <hi>Job 31. throughout the chapter.</hi> And for the ſecond part; the ſincere Chriſtian as hee doth ceaſe from all that is evil, ſo hee doth all that is good. The Hypocrite, many of them I mean, have not an
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170417:104"/> appearance of ſome Graces, Acts 8. 21. <hi>Thine heart is not right,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 9. 13. Either he is failing in his doing, or in his ſuffering. Hee is commonly failing in the doing of ſome duties or works. So the Phariſees, Mat. 23. 23, 24. <hi>and have omitted the weighty matters of the Law, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy, and truth,</hi> &amp;c. Hoſea 7. 7. 8, &amp;c. <hi>Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim hath mixed himſelf amon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt the people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he is a cake half baked,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 15. 2. <hi>Ye tranſgreſſed the commandements of God by your traditions.</hi> But the ſincere Chriſtian hee is compleat in all the will of God, he hath ſomewhat of every Grace, <hi>Col. 2. 10. You are compleat in him.</hi> Heb. 13. 21. He is careful to perform all duties to God and man, to other men, to himſelf. To other men, to good men, to bad men, to friends, to enemies, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to ſtrangers. In relation, as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Miniſter, People, Husband, Wife, Parent, Child, Maſter, Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Duties of Word, of Work, greater, leſſer, publick, private; of more and leſs advantage, as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. 2. <hi>who was a devout man, one that gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alwayes.</hi> Luke 1 6. And he doth alſo ſuffer all that God ſhall call him to ſuffer. Acts 21. 12. 13. And all this for the leaving of evil, and the doing of good. The ſincere Chriſtian doth his duty, 1 In all places. The Hypocrite he is not ſo carefull and exact in ſome, as he is in other places, at home and in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170417:105"/> private, as he is abroad and in publick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5. The Phariſees were in appearance very devout, and did much in the Sinagogues, and in the ſtreets, but did nothing at all in their cloſets. But the ſincere Chriſtian having his eye upon God, who is in all places alike, is alike carefull and exact in all places, in private as in publick, at home as abroad, in his cloſet as in his houſe, ſecretly as openly. So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 9, 10. when tempted by his wanton Miſtris to commit ſecret wickedneſs with her, anſwereth her, <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> Pſalm 101. 2. <hi>I will walk within my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 In all times, caſes and conditions. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, he is good at ſome times, and in ſome caſes, as in times of peace and proſperitie, and times wherein he may gain, and not loſe by his goodneſs, or whiles he is a wed by the preſence of good men, Parents, Magiſtrates, or Miniſtees, and the like, and no longer. And ſo it ſeems it was with <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 2. <hi>Who did tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the daies of Jehoiadah the Prieſt.</hi> And ſuch are thoſe ſervants, Epheſ 6. 6. <hi>That ſerve their masters with eye ſervice as men pleaſers,</hi> &amp;c. Job 27. 10. <hi>Will he alwaies call upon God?</hi> But the true Chriſtian is alike good and carefull in all times, caſes, changes, and conditions, in time of health as time of ſicknes,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170417:105"/> in time of peace as in time of trouble, <hi>Phil. 4. 11. I have learned in whatſoever eſtate I am therewith to be content.</hi> Job 1. 8. 12, 21, 22. And he is the ſame in the preſence of God onely, and when no other eye is upon him, <hi>Phil. 2. 12. As ye have alwaies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not in my preſence onely, but much more in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Servants be obedient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in ſingleneſs of heart as unto Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 3. 22. And he is the ſame in time of the perſecuted, as he is in the time of the flouring ſtate of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. He can (if need be) leave all for Chriſt, and the Goſpels ſake, 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5. <hi>But in all things approving our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in afflictions,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. v. 12. <hi>in ſimplicitie and godly ſinceritie, wee have had our converſation,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 10. 28. <hi>We have left all and followed thee.</hi> Acts 21. 12, 13. <hi>I am ready not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be bound, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 26, 27. Pſalm 119. 157, 161.</p>
               <p>3 In all company. The Hypocrite he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly better in ſome, than he is in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 2. But the true Chriſtian he is alike in all company, in the company of good, of bad men, of friends, of enemies, Pſalm 119. 46. <hi>I will ſpeak of thy teſtimonies before Kings,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>as ye have obeyed not onely in my preſence, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The true Chriſtian holds out to the end: The Hypocrite, he is at the beſt, <hi>unſtable in all his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170417:106"/> waies,</hi> James 1. 8. <hi>as a cloud without water carried by the wind.</hi> Iude v. 12. apt to ſtart aſide like <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful bow.</hi> Hoſea 7. 16. He is very like to ſtart aſide in times of trial. Iob 27. 10. <hi>Will he alwaies call upon God?</hi> And he doth very often fall clean away to prophaneſs in life, hereſie, and opinion, or to both. 1 Iohn 2. 19. <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us.</hi> 2 Pet. 2 22. <hi>It is happened to them according to the Proverb, The Dog is turned to the vomit again. and the low that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Sam. 13. 8. and 28. 7. Mat. 13. 21, 22. But this the ſincere Chriſtian connot doe <hi>Mat. 24. 14. <hi>They ſhall deceive if it were poſſible the very elect.</hi> For this new obedience of his is both a growing and increaſing obedience Rev. 2. 19. <hi>His laſt works are better than his firſt.</hi> And it is a laſting, perſevering, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obedience. Pſal. 119. 112. <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy ſtatutes, alwaies even to the end,</hi> v. 24. <hi>continnally for ever and ever,</hi> Luke 2. 37. Yea and he doth commonly grow better &amp; better, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 21. 2 Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. But the Hypocrite hee doth commonly grow worſe and worſe, 2 Tim. 3. 13. <hi>But Seducers wox worſe and worſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being deceived,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 20. This new obedience therefore of the new creature is ſuch, as it breaks through, and gets over all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, Acts 2. 42. <hi>Such as theſe</hi> (i.) mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and threats.</hi> Acts 4. 19. <hi>Whether it be right in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170417:106"/> the ſight of God to hearken to you more than unto God judge ye?</hi> and 5. 29. <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men,</hi> Dan. 3. 12. 16.</p>
               <p>2 Mens examples of all ſorts. <hi>Ioſh. 24. 15. Chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Gen. 6. 9. and 7. 1.</p>
               <p>3 Worldly profits and advantages, ſuch as honour, pleaſure, riches, and the like. Heb. 11. 8. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was called to goe out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>went,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Moſes</hi> v. 24, 25. <hi>when he came to years he refuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>chooſing rather,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4 Carnal reaſonings. <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By faith Noah being warned of God in a dream,</hi> Gal. 1. 16, 17. I <hi>conferred not with fleſh and blood.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5 Relations and natural affections dependant upon them. Heb. 11. 17. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up, &amp;c. his ſonne, his only ſonne,</hi> Deut. 33. 9.</p>
               <p>But 2. the obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian is compleat and entire alſo as to him that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for it is the obedience of his whole man bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul. The obedience of the Hypocrite is commonly counterfeit, and not from his heart; ſometimes with a part of his heart only, and never with his whole heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. There is action without affection, the lips are without the heart in it. It cometh coldly from him, without any vigour or life of the inner
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170417:107"/> man, Ezech. 33. 31. <hi>their heart goeth after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 29. 13. <hi>This people draw nigh to mee with their mouth but their heart is far from me,</hi> Pſ. 78. 34, 35, 36. <hi>They returned and enquired early after God, nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for their heart was not right with him,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 3. 10. <hi>And yet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>her treacherous Siſter Judah hath not turned unto me with hgr whole heart but feignedly,</hi> &amp;c. Amos 8. 5, 6. Hoſea 7. 14. But the new obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian is a cordial and affectionate obedience of the whole inward and outward man both together. That which he beleeveth, and that which he doth, or leaveth undone, it is all frrom his very heart. Rom. 6. 17. <hi>You have obeyed from the heart the Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. And it is with the whole heart, <hi>Pſ. 119. 10, 145 With my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> &amp;c. So that what he doth he doth with his whole ſoul, mind, conſcience, wil, &amp; affections all concurring with him therein.

His grace within, and his work without is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, 2 Tim. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 6. 6. 1 Sam. 12. 20. Ezek. 11. 19, 20. Rom. 12. 8.</p>
               <p>5 As he is careful to doe all God requireth, and with the whole man, ſo is he careful to doe no more than God requireth. But the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170417:107"/> hath additions of his own and other mens inventions, <hi>Jer</hi> 32. 35. Pſ. 106. 39. Mat. 15. 2, 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6 The new obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian is a real obedience. 1 That of the Hypocrite is onely verbal and complemental, Mat. 21. 28, 29, 30. A certain man had two ſons, and he ſaid to one of them, Goe and work to day in my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; And he ſaid, I go ſir, but went not. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 45. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the thing which I ſay? But the obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian is an obedience that is in deeds as well as in words, <hi>Rom. 15. 18. Col.</hi> 3. 17. 2 That of the Hypocrite is feigned and counterfeit, as we have ſhewed, Pſ. 78. 36. But this of the ſincere Chriſtian is as he himſelf is indeed what he ſeemeth.</p>
               <p>7 This new obedience of the ſincere Chriſtian as it is exact and compleat for the matter ſo for the manner of it, and the mind of the doer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Hypocrite he onely mindeth the worke done, and not how it bee done, or with what minde hee doth it. But the ſincere Chriſtian is careful not only what he doth, but how &amp; with what mind he doth it. And for this he doth and ſuffereth it (i.) in Chriſts name, where the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth dare adventure to goe to God in his own name, and upon his own account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the name of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 13 &amp;c.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170417:108"/> 
                  <hi>He ſaw there a man that had not on a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 18. 11 <hi>the Phariſee praied, and ſaid, God I thank thee, I am not,</hi> &amp;c. Iohn 6. 64. and 7. 5. or otherwiſe ask doubtingly, Iames 1. 7, 8. The ſincere Chriſtian he dares not come to God but with Ieſus Chriſt in his heart and mouth; and ſo coming, he beleeves that he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted both in his perſon and ſervice. Hee doth ask in faith: his Prayer is the prayer of Faith, Iames 5. 15, 16. 1 Tim. 2. 8. Iames 1. 6. Heb. 11. 4, 6. <hi>By Faith Abel offered to God a more excellent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice than Cain, &amp;c. But without Faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe him; for he that cometh to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> Iohn 16, 23, 24. &amp; 14 6.</p>
               <p>2 He doth, and ſuffereth preparedly: where the Hypocrites heart in his coming to God in ſervice is altogether unprepared for it, as being voyd of the love and fear, and reverence of God in it, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 12. 14, and 20 23. Pſal. 78. 34, 35, 36. Iſa. 29. 13. The ſincere Chriſtian his heart is ready and prepared to and for his obedience in doing or ſuffering as an inſtrument when ſet in tune is ready to be plaid upon. He loves and fears God; hee hath high, holy, and reverend thoughts of Gods name, wayes, and worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Chron. 30 9. Pſalm 108. 1. Pſal. 57. 7 Rom. 1, 15 Mal 1. 6, 7, 8, 17. Deut. 10. 12. Acts 21. 13.</p>
               <p>3 He doth it ſincerely, where the Hypocrite doth it with a double and deceitful heart all
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170417:108"/> that he doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 4. 8. The ſincere Chriſtian he doth it with a true &amp; plaine heart, <hi>Heb. 10 22. Rom. 12. 8, 9. 1 Pet.</hi> 1 2. So the Magiſtrate ruling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. The Miniſter in preaching, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. 1 Theſ</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. but to this we have ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>4 He doth it cheerfully and joyfully. Where the Hypocrite is in his obedience (eſpecially in the ſervice of God) unwilling to, and unchear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it, and takes little or no delight, but is ſoon weary of, and tyred in it, <hi>Amos 8. 5. When will the new Moon be gone?</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 1. 15. <hi>Behold what a wearineſs it is.</hi> Job 27. 10. The true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian he delights in it, it is his meate and drink; the yoak herein upon him is an eaſie yoake to him, <hi>Pſal. 40 8. Mat 11. 30. Pſal. 119 47. I ſhall delight my ſelf in thy Commandments,</hi> 2 Cor, 8. 19. 1 <hi>Pet 5. 2. 2 Cor 9 7. Iſa. 58. 13. If thou call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> 1 Cor. 29 9.

               <p>5 He doth it patiently. Where the Hypocrite is commonly in that which he doth and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth impatient and complaining againſt God, Mal. 3. 14, 15. <hi>Ye ſay it is in vain to ſerve the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Kings 6. 33. <hi>This evil is from the Lord, what ſhould I wait,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 18. 25, 29 and 33. 17. 20. <hi>Numb. 14. 17. Pſal. 106. 25. Mat. 20. 12, 15. Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170417:109"/> 25. 23, 24. The ſincere Chriſtian hee is patient, and doth quietly ſubmit to the will of God therein, 1 Sam. 3. 17, 18. <hi>It is the Lord let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> 2 Kings 20. 19, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord.</hi> Job 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 He doth it diligently, where the Hypocrite is commonly in his obedience eſpecially in Gods ſervice careleſs and negligent, Mal. 1. 14. <hi>Which hath in his flock a male, and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 25. 24. He that had but one talent. The ſincere Chriſtian is uſuually ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent and exact herein, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 12. I will not be negligent,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 8. 22. 1 Tim. 4. 14.</p>
               <p>7 Hee doth it humbly, where the Hypocrite doth his work proudly, and conceitedly, as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. The ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth it with the ſenſe of his ſinne, and with a broken and contrite heart. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13.</p>
               <p>8 He doth it fervently, where the Hypocrite is cold and perfunctory in his ſervice. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15. The ſincere Chriſtian is fervent in ſpirit, and doth what hee doth fervently, <hi>Coll.</hi> 4. 12. James 5 16. Rom. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>9 He doth it lovingly, where the Hypocrite doth it often with corrupt affections. James 15. 16. amd 1. 19, 20. The ſincere Chriſtian doth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170417:109"/> it with love to God and man, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. 1 Cor. 13. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 8. Hee doth it not with the leaven of malice tnd wickedneſs, but with the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread of ſinceritie and truth.</p>
               <p>10 He doth it purely and holily. The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſincere Chriſtian is not onely pure for the manner, but it flows from pure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and motives; and is done by a pure rule, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o pure ends.</p>
               <p>2 It comes from a pure heart. That of the Hypocrite comes from a filthy heart, <hi>Acts 8. 21, 22. Mat.</hi> 23. 25. But this of the ſincere Chriſtian comes from a pure heart, a heart purified by the blood of Chriſt, and by the Spirit of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5,</p>
               <p>2 It is pure in the motives. by, and from which it is moved and carried. That which doth move and carry the Hypocrite in his obedience, is his ſelf-love, and ſelf-ends, and not any thing at all of God: he loveth not the commander, the command, nor the thing commanded for themſelves. Or if there be any thing of God in it, it is ſo much only as may ſerve his own ends therein, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. throughout. So <hi>Jehu. Saul, Judas,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p>Hee may ſometimes bee kept from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil perhaps by the fear of men, but very ſeldom by the fear of God, <hi>Mark 12. 12. Luke</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170417:110"/> 20. 19, 22. 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. 22. and 7. 17. and 19. 38. <hi>Mat. 14. 5. Mark 11. 32. Gen.</hi> 39. 9. But that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which doth move the ſincere Chriſtian in his obedience, is the love and fear of God. And from thence his deſire to pleaſe, and his feare to offend God, the goodneſs of the thing to bee done or ſuffered, the conſcience of his duty therein, and of his obligation thereunto by the love of God. Hee beleeves the promiſes becauſe God ſaith, and obeyes the commands becauſe God gives them. He loves the Law maker that commands, the Law or command it ſelf, and the thing commanded. Theſe, and ſuch like things as theſe doe eſpecially ſtir up, and carry on the ſincere Chriſtian to his obedience. So <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By Faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen, moved with fear prepared an Ark,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 119. 161. <hi>My heart standeth in awe of thy word,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>For the love of Christ conſtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c. 1. 17. <hi>Some out of love,</hi> Pſalm 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. John 21 15. and 16, 17. Pſ. 119. 97. 127. <hi>I loae thy Law</hi> Pſalm 40. 8. <hi>I delight to doe thy will, O God.</hi> Gen 39. 9. Job 31. 4. 14. 23. 2 Chron. 19. 6, 7. Epheſ. 6. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And this fear of God makes him careleſs of the commands and threats of men, <hi>Exod. 1. 17. The Midwives feared God,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 11. 27. <hi>By Faith be forſook Aegypt, not fearing the wrath of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:170417:110"/>
               <p>2 It is pure in the Rule by which his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is governed. The Hypocrite, he makes his own fancie, and the commands and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men his rule and warrant for what he doth therein. Mat. 15. 2. <hi>Why doe thy diſciples tranſgreſs the traditions of the Elders?</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 1. 14. John 4. 21, 22. Acts 17. 22. Mat. 23. 16, 17. But the ſincere Chriſtian, he makes the pure Word of God alone his rul e and warrant for whatſoever he beleeveth, doth and ſuffereth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. The new man is ſaid to be renewed in knowledge, <hi>Gal. 1. 9. Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Acts 13. 36.</p>
               <p>3 It is alſo pure for the manner of it, as is already ſhewed.</p>
               <p>4 This new obedience is pure in the ends of it. The Hypocrites end in all that he doth and ſuffereth is himſelf, as he is moved in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſelf-love, ſo is he carried to ſelf-ends. He ſeeks himſelf, not God and Chriſt, his main deſign and intention in all that hee doth and ſuffereth from the beginning to the end thereof, is eſpecially, if not only his own glory or praiſe, his own profit, or pleaſure, or ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfie his own luſts. He lookes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than at earthly pleaſures, comforts, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in this world. God is not in al his thoughts, or if hee be, it is onely to thinke how hee may ſerve himſelf upon him. And if God be in his eye, yet he lookes at ſomething beyond, above,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170417:111"/> above or before him. In ſhew he ſeeks God, but in truth he ſeeks himſelf. He ſeems to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God and Chriſt, but it is not for God and Chriſt, but for his own ſake. He follows Chriſt for the loaves, as the nine Leapers to be healed onely, <hi>Iohn 6. 26. Luke</hi> 17. 12. And as the ſheep doe follow the ſhepheard as long as the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of hay is in his hand, and no longer; and not as a childe that follows the father out of love, who wil follow him every where. The Phariſees did pray and give almes to be ſeen of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. They made long praiers to the end they might devoure widowes houſes. <hi>Hoſea 7. 14. Ye aſſemble for wine and corn.</hi> Zach 7. 5. <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me?</hi> &amp;c. Micah 3. 11. <hi>They judge for ieward, and divine for money, and yet lean upon me,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 20 30. Phil. 1. 17. <hi>Preached Christ out of envy.</hi> But the ſincere Chriſtian in all his active and paſſive obedience, as hee is carryed forth therein eſpecially from the love and feare of God and Chriſt, ſo doth he act therein for God and Chriſt as well as for himſelf. And indeed God is his great object, motive, end, and all in all: He followeth them as wel for their owne ſakes as for his owne ſake. They are his principal and ultimate end, and the center to which he tends in all that he doth and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. His main ſcope and ſpecial aim therein to which all is in his intention referred is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170417:111"/> God, and advance the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and to teſtifie his love to God; for the love of God ſhewed to him in Chriſt. And therefore it doth not ſatisfie him to do any thing as for the publick good, the Common wealth, or the like. So the Heathen men have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he goe higher, and ſhoot as far as the utmoſt white and mark of all, which is Gods glory; he cannot be ſatisfied to come ſhort of this, or to goe beyond it with reference to any thing elſe. Rom. 14. 8. <hi>Whether we live we live to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 1. 21. <hi>For me to live is Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 17. 12. <hi>The Leapers one of them when hee ſaw hee was healed returned and glorified God,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1. 17. <hi>Now to the King immortal,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 6. 16. <hi>Rev. 4. 11.

               <p>And next to Gods glory the true Chriſtian he doth in his obedience active and paſſive aim at, and deſign the good of all men, eſpecially of godly men: So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 33. <hi>Even as I not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13. 36. <hi>After hee had ſerved his own generation,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>And in this order of his working to thoſe ends he doth not onely follow the light of Gods Word, but the light of Nature, which ſome of the Heathen ſaw and taught. That man was not born for himſelf; but firſt for God, next for his country, and laſtly for himſelf.</p>

               <p>But by all this we have ſpoken of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and exact obedience of the ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, we do not intend, nor would be underſtood that the ſincere Chriſtians life is perfect, and without ſinne; for that is to affirm contrary to what the Holy Ghoſt affirmeth, and experience hath evidenced to us of the lives of all men, and the beſt men that ever lived, that they all had their faults, and to aſſure us thereof, ſome of them, yea very many of them are recorded in Scripture, and left us for our learning, to let us know that there is not a man that liveth &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.

That hee hath a real and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned will, and deſire, and a real intention and purpoſe, and doth his endeavour with all his might to doe and fulfil the whole wil of God therein. And he is grieved that he cannot doe it more perfectly. And that which he doth of it he doth in ſincerity. And when he hath done all, he thinketh himſelf to be but an unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and to have done leſſe than was his duty to doe. And he doth not truſt to himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but to the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt. And in this only or eſpecially in this point doth the ſincere Chriſtian eminently excel and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip all the Hypocrites, yea the moſt refined Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in the world, who have not any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained wil, deſire, purpoſe, or intention (but rather the contrary thereof) in them. Nor do they endeavour at all ſo to doe in all things as we have ſhewed elſwhere at large. And this progreſs towards the perfect doing in the ſincere Chriſtian is eſteemed with God as the perfect doing of the thing it ſelf, Heb. 11. 17. <hi>By Faith Abraham when hee was tried offered up

               <p>How Sinceritie and Hypocriſie are manifeſted. <hi>Or,</hi> The ſigns of Sinceritie and of Hypocriſie.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>This queſtion is partly anſwered before in <hi>Chapter</hi> 3. where wee have ſet forth, wherein Sinceritie and Hypocriſie doe conſiſt. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. wherein we have ſhewed, in what the ſincere Chriſtian doth differ from, and goe beyond the Hypocrite. But wee ſhall now in this place adde further ſome particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sincerity and Hypocriſie doe moſt eminently ſhew themſelves in the Profeſſors of Religion, and theſe alſo may ſerve for ſigns and markes thereof. And theſe wee ſhall alſo lay down the one aghinſt the other in way of oppoſition. But herein wee muſt premiſe four things by way of caution.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That amongſt theſe ſigns of Hypocriſie, ſome are more groſſe and palpable than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That neither the one, nor the other, on the one or on the other ſide, albeit they bee certaine and infallible in themſelves, yet may they not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170417:117"/> be ſo to us, whoſe hearts are deceitful above all things, and wee are ſo apt to bee deceived by them. Wee doe not propoſe them therefore as aoſolutely certaine and infallible as to us: For many of the things wee give, and lay downe through this whole worke as ſignes or markes of the ſincere Chriſtian, ſome appearance of the ſame things may be found in, and upon the Hypocrite. As for example. Hee may ſeem to have ſome delight in God. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. Hee may have ſome delight in good things. Matth. 13. 20. Marke 6. 20. Iſaiah 58. 2. and good men and their company. <hi>Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> So the fooliſh ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the company of the wiſe Virgins. Hee may have an appearance of all the graces of the Spirit within him, and ſeem to grow in them for a long time, perhaps to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. <hi>Mat. 13. 4, 5, 6. 20, 21, 22. Luke 6. 46.</hi> Hee may bee a conſtant Hearer of the VVord of GOD, and yeeld ſome obedience thereunto, as <hi>Herod, Amaziah,</hi> and others. 2 <hi>Chronicl. 25. 2, 9, 15, 16. Luke 6, 46, 47. Mark</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. Hee may deny himſelf in many things, avoyd evill, and repent of ſinne, as <hi>Ahab, Saul, Judas,</hi> others, and doe many other things, as we have before layd down at large. And on the other ſide, many of the things wee
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170417:118"/> have obſerved, or ſhall here further obſerve to be the ſignes, or marks, or workings of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. The likeneſs, or reſemblance, or (at the leaſt) ſome degrees thereof, or the thing it ſelf at ſome iime may be found in the ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. As for example, we read of them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or of ſome of them, at ſome time, or in ſome caſe unbelieving, <hi>Mat. 14. 31. Rom. 14. 23. Mat.</hi> 6. 30.

So now we finde it by ſad expirience, That theſe, and ſuch like evils are to be found too often ſtirring in the hearts and lives of the beſt Chriſtians. And the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of their being in the true Chriſtian and the Hypocrite wee have opened in another place.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we doe not preſently judge a man to be an Hypocrite in his ſtate becauſe he hath ſom Hypocriſie in him: For there is not a man that lives but hath Hypocriſie in him more or leſſe: Beſides that, every man is born an Hypocrite For of this ſinne as of all others wee have the ſeeds in our natures. But no man is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Hypocrite in his ſtate but ſuch a one as is under the reign and power of Hypocriſie, and that yeelds himſelfe up to it to obey it, an obſtinate and wilful Hypocrite. And not ſuch
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170417:119"/> a one as doth ſee it in himſelfe, deteſt, diſavow, bewaile it, and labour againſt it all hee can, he is not an Hypocrite albeit he have hypocriſie in him.</p>
            <p>4 And therefore in the next place this is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the concluſion which wee draw from all theſe things (as I have formerly intimated.) That rhe more of all the ſignes or marks of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie are to be found in, or upon any one man, the more evidence hee in whom they are found may have for his ſinceritie. And the more of the ſignes of Hypocriſie are to bee found in any one man, the more cauſe hee in whom the ſame is found hath to ſuſpect himſelfe thereof. The ſigns or marks follow.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> If there go ſo much to the making up of a true Chriſtian, and that in his heart there be ſuch a work of Grace as we have ſhewed, and no leſſe than this will ſpeak him ſincere, who then ſhall be ſaved?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we do anſwer.</p>
               <p>1 That wee know there is ſome Hypocriſie, more or leſſe in the beſt Chriſtian under heaven; for we are not perfect here.

The true Chriſtian may grow lukewarme, perhaps cold for a time: there are times of temptation with him, that as in the winter there doth outwardly appear no difference between a dead tree and a living tree, both are without fruit and leaves, ſo between a true and counterfeit Chriſtian.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this wee are to know, That as there is a ſtrong, ſo a weak Chriſtian. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. and there are little children as well as young men and fathers in Chriſtianity. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 13. ſo amongſt them that are weak there are two ſorts, or Chriſtians are weak in two caſes, or under two conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Such as are now weak by accident but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170417:136"/> have been ſtronger at other times, and ſo the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian may become weak as a man that is ſtrong in his natural ſtrength of his body may by ſickneſſe, faſting, or the like bee brought to be ſo weak that a child may puſh him down, or he may be ready to fall of himſelfe. And as the natural body by a diſtemper, from a diſeaſe, a blow on the head, or ſome other accident may lye a while for dead, ſo it is with the ſpiritual body of the new man, and with his ſpiritual ſtrength. It may be by ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſſures and burdens of affliction, or temptation (for the preſent) brought to a very low and weak eſtate, and perhaps into a kinde of ſwound, to have in appearance very little or no ſign of life left, but to bee as it were ſtarke dead. But there are another ſort of weake Chriſtians, and they are ſuch as were never ſtronger. And ſuch are (for the moſt part) all Chriſtians at their firſt comming into Chriſt, they are rude, and raw, and have but little faith; ſuch were Chriſts diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 30. and 8. 26. and 16. 8. <hi>Mark 9 19, 24. Nathaniel, John</hi> 1. 45, 46, 20, 27. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22. And yet it is ſo poſſibly with ſome (as it ſeems it was with <hi>Paul)</hi> that they have very much of the Spirit given them, and they are very ſtrong Chriſtians at the firſt. But for the moſt, even of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170417:136"/> they are weak and childiſh in the things of God a while after the firſt converſion; and ſome of them may happily continue ſo for a long time, as ſome children as to their naturall ſtrength doe by ſome diſtemper continue weak, and grow but a little for a long while: Yea poſſibly it may be ſo in the firſt converſion of a ſinner to God, that as the ſeed of Corn that is caſt into the earth dyeth, and lyeth long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ariſeth, yet having a ſeed of life in it, it doth at length ariſe and grow. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 36, 37. and come to perfection. So little of ſpiritual life, or the life of the new creature may appear for a long time in that ſoul which may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be quickned and truly alive to God in Chriſt. We ſhall ſay a word to both of theſe kindes of weakneſſe, and weak Chriſtians; touching whom we ſay, That ordinarily in the weakeſt of true Chriſtians of this ſecond ſort, and in the loweſt and weakeſt eſtate of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, conſidered apart, and free from violent temptations, aſſaults and oppoſitions, theſe things are alwayes ſeen, and are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The weakeſt Chriſtian muſt bee in Chriſt by Faith and a new creature. As one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſayd to bee of the nature of man, or of mankinde till that hee bee born and brought forth of the womb of his mother,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170417:137"/> So neither can one bee, or bee ſaid to bee a true Chriſtian till he be born again, and Chriſt be formed in him. John 1. 12. <hi>But to as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, to them gave he power to be the ſonnes of God, even to them that beleeve on his name, which were born, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 He muſt by this means be ſpiritually alive, and riſen from the death of ſin, Eph. 2. 1. <hi>You that were dead hath hee quickned.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Chriſt liveth in me, and the life I now live,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He is then of the ſame nature, and therefore muſt be more or leſs like unto the ſtrongeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as children to men, lambs to ſheep, and the moſt tender branches to the great bows of tree. So the weakeſt Chriſtian notwithſtanding his weakneſs, is partaker of the divine nature of God in Chriſt, 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Whoreby are given us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and pretious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature.</hi>
               </p>

It is ſometimes with the ſpiritual man as it is with the natural man, and his natural ſtrength: the ſame may bee by ſome accident or diſtemper very much decaied and impaired, and the man though otherwiſe a ſtrong man grow very weak, and ſeeme to bee dying. So it is in this caſe, a ſincere Chriſtian (ſometime ſtrong) may by a relapſe into ſinne, or ſome grievous preſſure of affliction inward or outward, or both, grow for a time very weake in grace, his pulſe beat weak, and his breath ſhort, as if hee were near dying, yea ſometimes (though very rarely) it falls out ſo, that all the motions, exerciſes and operations of Grace in the true Chriſtian, may be for a while ſo much ſuſpended, that they may ſeem (in appearance) to be totally extinct. So that as in the natural body it falls out ſometimes by ſome accident or diſtemper, all the motions and ſymptomes of life, as ſight, hearing, breathing, and the like ſeemes to be ſtopped, and nothing of the natural life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.

               <p>The trial of the ſinceritie of works. And what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make a work good.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd now from the tryal of the ſincerity of Perſons and hearts we come to the tryal of the ſinceritie of Workes and Services. And for this we are to know, That there are many things required, whereunto the ſincere Chriſtian hath reſpect, for the making of a ſervice and worke good, or a ſuffering acceptable. There is ſome thing repuired in the perſon doing or ſuffering. And ſome things there are required in the thing to be done and ſuffered. 1 In the perſon doing or ſuffering it is requiſite, that he be rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170417:139"/> 2 In the thing to be done or ſuffered. 1 It is requiſite it be done by a right rule or warrant. 2 In a right manner. 3 And to right ends. For the qualification of the perſon doing or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is requiſite that hee be in Chriſt by faith, and ſo one with him, and thereby become a new creature, a childe of God. <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. and ſo accepted in his perſon, for otherwiſe his worke cannot be accepted. For God muſt firſt have reſpect to him, ere he will have reſpect to his offering or ſervice. Dent. 33. 10, 11. <hi>They ſhall teach Iacob, &amp;c and accept the works of his hands.</hi> Gen. 4. 4, 5. <hi>And the Lord had reſpect to Abel and to his offering.</hi> But God heareth not ſinners. Iohn 9. 31. Prov. 15. 8. 21. 27. And of all ſinners the Hypocrite is the greateſt ſinner. Mat. 22. 11, 12. <hi>one not having on a wedding garment. And he ſaid, Friend, how comeſt thou in here?</hi> Rev. 19. 8. Zach. 3. 1. Pſal. 45. 13, 14. 2 For the thing to bee done and ſuffered. 1 It muſt come from a right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, from the Spirit of God in this new man, and from his renewed nature. 2 As a conſequent of the former, it muſt be done by him out of a pure heart (that is) a conſcience that doth not know of any guilt or of wilfull wickedneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or man upon it, but that it doth in al things deſire to live according to the Word of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. &amp; 24. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. 1 Tim. 1. 5. <hi>Now the end of the commandement is love out of a pure heart,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170417:140"/> and good conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> And there is no work that any prophane man doth, that therefore can bee good, becauſe it comes from an evil heart, and the fountain and tree being corrupt, the ſtreames and fruit muſt be ſo alſo. Mat. 12. 34, 35. Iames 3. 11. Prov. 15. 8. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abhomination to the Lord.</hi> Prov. 28. 9. And hee muſt be moved and carried forth in his doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering by and from right and true conſiderations and motives. As from a love and reſpect to God that commandeth the work, ariſing from the ſenſe of Gods love to his perſon, a love to the command it ſelf, a love to the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Iohn 5. 13. <hi>For this is the love of God that we keep his Commandements.</hi> And by, and from a ſenſe and apprehenſion of Gods Greatneſs, Mercy, Goodneſs, Iuſtice, Holyneſs, and Wiſdome, and his royal command upon him, his Soveraignty over him, as his Creator, Lord and King, and the Conſcience of his obedience due to God, and the danger of diſobedience, Iob 31. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>I made a covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the workers of iniquity? &amp;c. Doth hee not ſee my waies?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What then ſhall I doe when he riſeth?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By reaſon of his highneſs I could not endure.</hi> Heb. 11. 7. <hi>By Faith Noah being warned of God, &amp;c. moved with reverence,</hi> Rom. 7. 12. <hi>The Commandement is holy, juſt, and good.</hi> Pſal. 19. 7, 8. <hi>The Law of God is perfect,</hi> &amp;c. From
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170417:140"/> the fear of God, a deſire to pleaſe, and feare to offend him. Exod. 1. 15, 16, 17. <hi>The Midwives feared God.</hi> Gen. 42. 18. <hi>this doe and live, for I fear God.</hi> From a ſenſe of the wrong he hath done to God by his ſin, and the plyableneſs of his heart therein to make what amends to God it can, and from the great reward there is promiſed to the obedient. The work I ſay and ſervice to be done and thing to be ſuffered, when well and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table muſt bee undertaken upon theſe, or ſome ſuch like motives and conſiderations. <hi>Pſ. 44. 21. Eph. 5. 14. Col. 3. 22. Heb. 11. 4, 5, &amp;c.</hi> But the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage herein is when one is moved or carried forth herein out of ſelf-love only, for fear that he may have hurt by the not doing or ſuffering, or out of hope that he may have good by the doing or ſuffering; or when it comes from ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous conceite or opinion of God and his owne ſervice to God, that he cannot be without his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or is much beholding to him for what hee doth, or that it is accepted with God for it ſelfe however it be done or the like. <hi>Iſ 66. 1. 2,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The heaven is my throne, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) doe you think that I ſo much care for your Temple ſervice: <hi>But to this man wil I look,</hi> i. e. that is him and his ſervice ſhall I favour and accept <hi>[that is poor and of a contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that trembleth at my word]</hi> that is him that is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his emptineſſe of grace, and guiltineſs of ſin, and hath his heart broken for and from ſin.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170417:141"/> This is the ſoul which is the temple wherin I wil dwel, and theſe are the ſacrifices in ſuch a ſoule that I ſhall accept. <hi>He that killeth an oxe is as if he ſlew a man</hi> (that is) all theſe outward perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and ſervices, without theſe inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and affections of ſoul, are no better than the ſervices and ſacrifices of an heathen than the moſt vile and horrible crimes committed againſt my Law, when he that doth them is moved and carried forth therein from ſome corrupt or ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſpect, and not by or from any love or fear of God at all. 1 Cor. 13. 1. 2. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongue, of men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding braſſe, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of Propheſie, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I am nothing.</hi> See more for this <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33. 18. 34. 18. 138. 6. 147. 6 51. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 3 That there bee a warrant or rule for the thing to bee done and ſuffered. And for this, 1 That the thing to be done or ſuffered be commanded, or at the leaſt not forbidden. 2 That it be known too, and beleeved by him that doth or ſuffereth it. 3 That it bee done according to this rule or command by him known and beleeved. For the firſt. The thing to be done muſt be good, either it muſt be commanded, or at leaſt it muſt not be forbidden by Gods Word. For if ſo it be that the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170417:141"/> thing be forbidden, be it don never ſo cordially, or that a man be preſſed never ſo much to it by his conſcience, yet is the thing nevertheleſs evill. And therefore their ſin in offering their children to <hi>Molech.</hi> Lev. 20. 2. Jer. 32. 35, 36. and in the killing of Chriſts Diſciples was nevertheleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for this, nor will a good intention or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this caſe help. And therefore we finde in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 11. <hi>Saul,</hi> and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> both of them ſeverely puniſhed for the doing (and probably with a good intention) of that which was good in it ſelf to have been done by another, but evill in them, becauſe it was a thing prohibited to them. And of this nature is their Popiſh whipping of themſelves, pilgrimage, faſting, and ſuch like things amongſt them, and the imitation of them by others. Col. 2. 18. 23. <hi>Touch not, taſte not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which things indeed have a ſhew of wiſdom in will-worſhip and humilitie,</hi> &amp;c. And God will ſay of this, as Iſa. 1. 12. <hi>who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired theſe things at your hands?</hi> and as Jer. 32. 35. <hi>which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind.</hi> Deut. 12. 8. 2 The thing done muſt bee knowingly and beleevingly done (that is) hee muſt know it to be commanded, allowed, or warranted by Gods Word; for otherwiſe, be it never ſo lawful, as the eating of fleſh, yet if a man doubt of the lawfulneſs of it, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him ſo long as he doubteth. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170417:142"/> is not of Faith is ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. 23. And it muſt bee done with a perſwaſion that God will accept it being ſo done. Gen. 4. 4. Heb. 11. 4, 6. <hi>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſacrifice than Cain,</hi> &amp;c. But without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>&amp;c. For he that cometh to God muſt beleeve that God is,</hi> &amp;c And for the third. It muſt be done for matter and manner accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of the Word laid down for the doing thereof. <hi>Gal,</hi> 6. 16. <hi>And to as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 13. 36. <hi>But David after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, &amp;c.</hi> But the error in this principally is when a man in that he doth and ſuffereth hath his eye altogether or chiefly upon his own fancy, or upon humane Traditions Commands and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. Iohn 4. 21, 22. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what.</hi> Mat. 15. 9. <hi>In vain they doe worſhip me, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for doctrines the commandements of men.</hi> Acts 17. 23.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170417:142"/> which is amongſt you, taking the overſight thereof not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 6. <hi>Not with eye-ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doing the will of GOD from the heart: with good will doing ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10. 34. <hi>Yee took joyfully the ſpoyling of your goods,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 110. 3. Deut. 30. 10. Ierem. 31. 33. Gen. 9. 27. 5 The next great thing to bee looked unto, and required in the workes we do and things wee ſuffer to make our work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acceptable, is the end and deſigne of the heart in it: For as a man may ſpeake good words to an evil end. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 15. ſo one may doe good works to an evill end. The great and maine end and deſigne of the heart in every thing a man doth and ſuffereth, ought to bee to and for God (that is) to pleaſe and glorifie GOD, and advance the Name of the Lord Ieſus by what hee doth and ſuffereth, and by his chearefull ſervice therein to teſtifie his love to God: For this is primarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Exod. 20. 2, 3. I <hi>am the Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thon ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> And this is primarily to be prayed, and laboured for, Mat. 6. 9. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name</hi> (that is) grant us by thy VVord and VVorkes as thou haſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted thereby, eſpecially by the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Ieſus Chriſt rightly to know thee in thy wonderful nature and incomprehenſible
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170417:143"/> Attributes, and be brought every way in heart, word, and deed, to acknowledge, and by a right inward and outward worſhip of thee to exalt thee. VVhence we may thus argue; That which is of God chiefly required, and of man chiefly to be deſired, to this muſt every work of man bee chiefly intended and directed. But that already named is that very thing. 1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>Yee are bought with a price, wherefore glorifie him,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Do all to the glory of God.</hi> John 7. 18. <hi>But he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>John</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14, 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23, 24 <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 67. And in the next place his aym and deſign muſt bee to do good to the people, eſpecially the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he doth live. 1 Cor. 10 31, 32, 33. <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20. 1 Cor 8. 8, 9, 10. Luke 7. 5, 6. Gal 6. 10. <hi>Let us do good to all men, eſpecially to them who are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> But that which maketh the ſervice Hypocritical and unacceptable in this is, when he that doth it, mindeth himſelf onely in it, when he doth it, either to ſtill the noyſe of his own conſcience, or to get him a name, or to procure himſelf ſome outward advantage in the world thereby. Joh. 6. 26. <hi>Ye follow me for the loaves,</hi> &amp;c. or at the moſt to ſave his ſoul by it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that cannot be done otherwiſe. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170417:143"/> any love to God to whom the work is done, or love of the work done. And without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all to Gods glory, or the good of other men. Epheſ. 6. 5. Col. 3. 22. <hi>Not with eye ſervice, as men pleaſers.</hi> Matth. 6. 2, 10. <hi>Ye doe it to be ſeen of men.</hi> Mat. 23. 14. <hi>That ye may appear to men,</hi> &amp;c. Or for a worſe end, James 4. 3. <hi>Ye ask amiſs, that you may conſume it on your luſts.</hi> Phil. 1. 17. 2 Cor. 4. 2. 5. 12. See more for this in Chap. 7. Sect. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be asked, whether a man in the good he doth, and evil he ſuffereth, may not have an eye alſo to his own good, a temporal reward here, as wel as to his eternal ſalvation hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which we anſwer: Yes doubtleſſe: 1 For God doth ſet this before him to encourage him in it; and no Scripture motive can draw out any unlawful affection, and whatſoever Gods VVord requireth, the Spirit of God worketh by degrees in the heart of the Beleever. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
            <p>2 The ſervants of God it is true have within them an ingenuous and ſupernatural principle, whereby they love God, and holy things becauſe of the excellency of them; even as a carnall man loveth ſin, becauſe of the ſutableneſſe of it with his own heart. And yet Gods ſervants in the things they have done and ſuffered, have had an eye, yea a fixed and conſtant eye upon their owne temporal and eternal good alſo for their encouragement therein, Heb. 11. 14, 26. <hi>For
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170417:144"/> they that ſay ſuch things declare plainly that they ſeek a Country. For hee had reſpect unto the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> 3 Our Lord Jeſus in that he did &amp; ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had an eye to this. Heb. 2. 2. <hi>Looking unto Ieſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him endured the croſs,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore all <hi>amor mercedis</hi> is not <hi>amor mercenarius.</hi> Some make Gods glory and our happineſs to differ as the ſupream and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ends, ſome as coordinate ends one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but to be ſure GOD hath ſo infallibly eonjoyned them together, that one cannot bee without the other. So that by all this now wee may try our ſelves as to our workes, and our works themſelves whether they be ſuch as God will approve; whether they be wrought in God. <hi>Gal. 6. 4. But let every man prove his own works, and then ſhall he have rejoycing,</hi> &amp;c. The more they doe anſwer to theſe rules, the more perfect they are; and the more they ſwerve from them, the more they ſavour of Hypocriſie in them.</p>

               <p>Our third word of Exhortation is. 1 To the Profeſſing followers and appearing friends of Chriſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170417:148"/> 2 To others. to them which ſeem to be friends of Chriſt, to all ſuch as are entered into the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt. We perſwade them, That ſeeing there is ſo much deceit, and ſo many are miſtaken and do miſcarry in it, that they do therefore take the more care of themſelves and others herein. And for this. That 1 they doe the more fear and ſuſpect themſelves, that they alſo may be deceived. Is it not ſeaſonable to adviſe men to take heed what money they receive when there is much counterfeit coyn going abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men? And when we hear of many Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks by Sea of Ships richly laden with many precious Jewels in the way wee and others are to paſs, is it not then a good time to perſwade our ſelves and others that are to go that way to fear, and to look well to our tackling and our way? Many there are, doubtleſs very many, that think they are good Chriſtians, and are accepted, and approved of for ſuch amongſt others, but are not ſo, Rev. 2. 9. <hi>call themſelves Jews and are not.</hi> Luke 16. 15.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170417:148"/> the natural Sun-beams. Let us view our ſelves well by this Looking glaſs, and ſee what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons we are, whether true or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Chriſtians. And there is great reaſon for it why wee ſhould ſo doe. 1 It is commanded of God, 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Try your ſelves whether you be in the faith or no.</hi> 2 The godly do ſo Pſal. 139. 23, 24. <hi>Search me O God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>try me,</hi> &amp;c.

And if now any man ask us, what if upon ſearch I find my caſe doubtful and dangerous, what ſhall I doe? Wee anſwer; The beſt way is to begin all again, as a man that hath layd the foundation of his build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amiſs, or is going in a wrong way to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end; for the Hypocrite and the worſt of wicked men as they are alike evil, ſo is their caſe alike dangerous, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51. compared with <hi>Luke</hi>

In the third place, then our Exhortation ſhal be to ſuch as theſe that have laid an ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to our ſelves, and all others who are entring into, or entred, or ſhall hereafter enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the profeſſion of Religion, and are following, or to follow Chriſt therein, That they and we doe ſeriouſly conſider of what wee are going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that therein our caſe is as the caſe of a man that is going a long and a dangerous journey, or run a race for a great prize, or engage in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate battel alone, or with others, <hi>Eph. 6. 12. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 7. or are going about to ſet up a great building, or going to make a great purchaſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12.

And that therefore we doe as men to go ſuch a journey, or doe ſuch a work, theſe two things. 1 Remove all hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. 2 Provide our ſelves with al neceſſaries for the way and work. Amongſt other hinderances herein, let us take heed, 1 of unbelief, a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſin, by which the Iſraelites were kept &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

And for proviſion for our journy or our work, 1 Let us look wel to our foundation that it be wel laid <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. 13. 22. that it be layd upon Chriſt; <hi>for other foundation can no man lay than that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready layd, which is Ieſus Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 33. 11 <hi>Eph.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 20. and that we lay it low enough. And that for this, we find our hearts by the Word and Spirit of God not only deeply convinced of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and by our owne original, and actual ſin, but that we be broken and humbled in heart for and converted from it. <hi>Hab. 6. 1. Acts 2. 37, 38. Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. And having a diſcoverie made by this VVord and Spirit, that there is a Remedy to be had in this caſe by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, That he will be to the repenting beleeving ſinner, as the City of Refuge was to the Manſlayer. <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. And as the poole of <hi>Betheſda</hi> was to him that was firſt put into it after the Angel had troubled it, 10. 5. 2, &amp;c. And as the brazen Serpent was to them that were ſtung by the fierie Serpent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 6.

For our places of Truſt in the Commonwealth. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 8. and 13. 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 13. For our ſervants in our families. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 101. 6. And for all our other works and buſineſs. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
               <p>Our fifth word of Exhortation is to all men profeſſing Religion, That ſeeing it is ſo (as wee have ſhewed) That ſo many goe ſo far towards,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170417:151"/> and yet go without it; they ſtrive for it, and yet cannot get it, that we ſtrive the more earneſtly, and labour the more abundantly herein. And this is the very uſe that our Saviour doth make of this point. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 23, 24. <hi>Lord, are there few that ſhall be ſaved? And he ſaid nnto them, ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, &amp;c.</hi> Shall we come ſo near to it and goe without it? <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. Shall we doe and ſuffer ſo much for it in vain? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. Shall we get on Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> in ſight of <hi>Canaan</hi> and not enter it? Shall we bid almoſt to one penny the full price for Chriſt, and let another come after us and take away our bargain from us? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Let us reſolve, though it coſt us our blood we will have it, and that we will goe beyond all the Hypocrites in the world, let them go as far as they can. But happily ſome man may ſay here, To what purpoſe ſhall we ſtrive if there be ſuch a difficulty in it; it is impoſſible by all the labour in the world to be done. To this we anſwer. 1 It is certain the work is hard &amp; difficult, and yet it is not ſo hard as to be impoſſible, but it is poſſible may be done. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. 2 There is no poſſibilitie of having it without this paines and labour. And it will bee therefore in this, as in men that are eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a place or office for which many do ſtand each of which and no others are capable; in this caſe any one of them that ſtand for it may poſſibly have it, but hee that never labours
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170417:152"/> for it will never have it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. ſhould not this provoke a man to labour the more for it. And ſo ſhould the difficultie in this caſe provoke all men to be the more induſtrious to attain it. 3 If we have it not we are without queſtion, &amp; ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably loſt and undone for ever. Our caſe in this therefore is like the Leprous men, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 4. If we ſit ſtill in our naturall and impenitent eſtate, we are ſure to dye there. Let us therefore reſolve as they did, <hi>Let us fall into the hoſt of the Syrians, if they ſave us alive we ſhall live; and if they kill us we ſhall but die.</hi> So let us ſay, we will doe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for heaven, we will put our ſelves upon the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſtrive with all our might for heaven, if we periſh, we periſh, we can but dye. 4 But in the laſt place: If we ſhall doe our utmoſt endeavour in truth to attaine it, we have no cauſe to doubt the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, and our acceptance and ſucceſs the rein; for God is gracious, and Chriſt is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and hath promiſed ſo to doe, and he is faithful and able to perform what he promiſeth. <hi>Math.</hi> 11 28.

               <p>Our ſixth and laſt word of Exhortation is to all that now doe, or hereafter ſhall appeare as Chriſtians, and follow Chriſt in the profeſſion of Religion, and have a form of godlineſs. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to Sincerity and againſt Hypocriſie herein, to be pure and upright in heart and life. And that they lye not to God and men, whiles they pretend to be, and have the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and are not ſo indeed but counterfeit ones onely. To perſwade them (and oh that we might prevail herein) that they would lay aſide al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of guile and deceit herein: And labour to be plain &amp; ſimple hearted in thought word &amp; deed. That they do not compaſs God about with lyes, and flatter and diſſemble with him whiles their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170417:153"/> hearts are not right and perfect before him. That they do not pretend to prefer God above all, &amp; have no other God but him, whiles they love, fear, and truſt in themſelves, and other men and things more than God, ſeeke the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God: That they call not God their Father and Maſter whiles they deſpiſe his Name, and do not honour him as a ſonne his father, nor fear him as a ſervant his maſter. That they doe not teach Gods fear by the precepts of men. That they give not to God a worſe, when they have a better to give him in his ſervice. That they do not pretend to enquire after, ſeek, ſerve, and obey him with their whole heart, whiles they ſeek themſelves, and to ſerve themſelves upon God therein. That they do not pretend to faith, love, repentance, fear, and the like towards God, whiles they know there is no ſuch thing, but the contrary thereof in their heart. That they doe not pretend to draw nigh to God in his worſhip, whiles their hearts are far removed from him &amp; it. That they do not pretend to form of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whiles they deny the power thereof. That they do not ſay they know him, and keep not his commandements. That they doe not profeſſe to know God, whiles in their works they deny him. That they do not ſay they are Saints, whiles they live like not devils. That they do name the Name of the Lord, unleſs they depart from iniquity
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170417:154"/> And as for Rulers of Churches, Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and Families, Judges, and ſuch like men; that they ſay not they rule and judge for God, and lean upon him, whiles they ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own things, and not the things of God, and the peoples good. And for Chriſtian Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they ſay not they are of God, ſent of Chriſt, Miniſters of the Goſpel, &amp; workers with Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whiles they appear to be deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workers, to ſpeak lyes in hypocriſie, to deceive the ſimple with fair words, to ſeek to pleaſe men, to ſeek their own things, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſerve their bellyes, to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of mens ſoules, to hunt after filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and ſo goe themſelves, and lead others with them to deſtruction. And that neither Heads, Prieſts, nor Prophets leane upon the Lord &amp; ſay, He is amongſt us, whiles they judge for reward, teach for hire, and divine for mony. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50. 16, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27, 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43. 24. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 36, 37. But on the other ſide let us perſwade ſuch men profeſſing godlines, That they get the new life, the immediate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and habits of Grace, and the operations, motions, effects, and fruits thereof. And then that they labour for, and get a perfect heart, a heart perfect with the Lord. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 19. That they walk before God in truth, and with a perfect heart. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. That

That whatſoever they doe unto men be not done with eye-ſervice, as men plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, but as doing the wil of God from the heart, heartily, with ſingleneſs of heart, with good wil, as the ſervants of Chriſt, as ſerving him, fearing God, and as unto the Lord. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8.

               <p>Arguments to perſwade to Sinceritie, and againſt Hypocriſie in the general.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE next thing we have to do is to lay down ſomething by way of motive, to perſwade
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170417:156"/> not only to a Chriſtian life, but alſo to Sincerity and againſt Hypocriſie therein. And this firſt in general: And in the next place, in particular ſervices, to perſwade us to be Chriſtians indeed, to the profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, and to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity therein. And to move us to labour to bee, and to keep ſincere in our ſtate, or in the general: Beſides what we have before layd down, let us take up and uſe theſe following conſiderations. 1 Hypocriſie in Religion is a ſin we are all very prone to; for every man by nature is an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and every true Chriſtian hath more or leſs hypocriſy in him. Job 31. 33. <hi>If I cover my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Adam by hiding mine iniquity in my boſom.</hi> Gen. 3. 12. Hence it is that Chriſt bids his Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it. <hi>Mat. 6. 1. Luke</hi> 12. 1. 2 Yea it is much to be feared, that Hypocriſie in Religion is now very common, and that Hypocrites are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that Hypocriſie is now become the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſe of the time, becauſe there is now more to breed &amp; feed it than in former times, Religion is now in requeſt, &amp; the greateſt and moſt of men be religious. Religion is now looked upon with a good eye, and religious godly men are now in great eſteem with the greateſt men of the time; ſo that it is now as in the time ſpoken of in <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>The Iews had light, and gladneſs, and joy, and honour, &amp;c. and a good day, and many of the people of the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Iews, for the fear of the Iews fell upon them.</hi> A falſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170417:156"/> heart will work upon this, and the man in whom it is will for his outward advantage in the world put himſelf into any form of Religion. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. 3 The ſin of Hypocriſie in the nature and working of it is a moſt dangerous ſin. For, 1. It is a ſoul-pleaſing ſin, being a part of the old man, and natural to us. <hi>Pſ. 52. 3. thou loveſt evil, &amp;c. and lying, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſea 12. 7, 8. Col. 3. 9. 2 It is a ſoul killing ſin. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21, 22, 23. 3 It is of a very infectious nature. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12, 13. 4 It is (as we have ſaid) a very common evill: where the contagion of the plague is common, the danger is greater. 5 It is hardly diſcerned in him in whom it is. It is (as we ſay in the Proverb) ſpun with a fine thred; it cannot be ſpyed by another. Nay it is in ſome caſes hard to be found by him in whom it is. The refined hypocriſie, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite are in themſelves in ſome caſes very hard to be found at all. And the groſs Hypocriſy after a long continuance therein is by him in whom it is hardly diſcerned alſo; for it is with him as a lyar, who by oft repeating of his lyes, beginneth to beleeve them to bee true; ſo the Hypocrite at length deceives himſelf. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 26. And becauſe the Hypocrite is of God judicially blinded and hardned in it; it being juſt with God to puniſh deceit with deceit, and therefore Hypocriſie doth very often end in hardneſs and groſs blindneſs. Hoſea 12. 7, 8. <hi>And Ephraim ſaid, yet I am become rich,</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:170417:157"/> &amp;c. <hi>In all my labours they ſhall find no iniquitie,</hi> &amp;c Iſa. 30. 1, 2. 6 It is now become a gainfull and profitable ſin. 7 It is hardly to bee cured, not onely becauſe it is hardly diſcerned, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is ſick of it, is not willing to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it; for it is his trade of life, and ſeldome or never doe we hear of ſuch an Hypocrite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from his Hypocriſie; for the Hypocrite can hardly be drawn to ſee, more hardly to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and moſt hardly to uſe the means for the cure of his diſeaſe. Or if he doe uſe means, ſuch is the nature of Hypocriſle that it turns the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine into poyſon, and it a boſeth Religion to the feeding of the humour, to the deſtruction of the ſoul; nor can hee expect any good by the means whiles he doth ſo continue. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 6. 8 It is a kind of Idolatry and Atheiſm both together. It is in effect to ſay God cannot ſee,; for all the profeſſion, ſpeaking, acting, and thoughts of the Hypocrite are alwaies for himſelf, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his <hi>primum principum,</hi> and his <hi>finis ultimus,</hi> and ſo ſets himſelf in the place of, or rather above God; to give to God the worſt, and to himſelf a ſinful man the beſt. 9 There is a kind of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. 10. It is a peece or degree of the ſin again the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24, 29 30, 31. 4 It is, as a dangerous, ſo a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and abominable ſin, abhorred of God and all good men; for it is a lye, and a lye to God.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170417:157"/> 
               <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. Yea it is abhorred even of nature in ſelf, and therefore no man can endure to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrite or diſſembler. It is therefore (as one ſaith of it) the plague of all plagues; in its own nature a deſperate ſinne, a deadly diſeaſe; for it ſmites at the vital parts of a man; it eats out all life &amp; goodneſs out of the will, in time puts out the eyes of the mind, deadeth and ſeareth the natural conſcience, eats out the good affections in the heart. It is a rottenneſs at the core, leaven in the midſt, poyſon in the Fountain, it corrupts the heart from whence it diffuſeth it ſelfe as it were through all the veins of the whole conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And Sincerity will keep a man from all this danger. 5 Sincerity is a moſt amiable and deſirable thing in it ſelf; for if the appearance of godlineſs be ſo deſirable, that the Hypocrite doth aſſume it, what is the thing it ſelf, that muſt needs be much more diſirable?

            <p>AND now to perſwade us to Sincerity in our particular Works and Services, eſpecially in the ſervice of God, we may take up and uſe theſe motives. 1 God is upright in his work, and all that he doth he doth in uprightneſſe, and wee are to be followers of God. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 41. <hi>And I will plant them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with my whole heart, and whole ſoul.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 1. <hi>Be ye therefore followers of God as dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> 2 God requires uprightneſs in us in all that we doe in his ſervice. <hi>Heb.</hi> 20 22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart,</hi> &amp;c.

Keep thy foot when thou goeſt into the houſe of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth,</hi> &amp;c. 4 This is Goſpel ſervice, and fit for Goſpel times, and Goſpel worſhippers; and ſuch ſervice as God doth call for. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>The hour cometh and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip him in ſpirit and truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> Jer. 24. 7. with 3. 10. Ezek. 36. 26, 27. 5 This is the only beautiful and excellent ſervice where there is an harmony and conſent between the ſoul and the body in the work. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4, 6.

Pſ. 51. 16, 17. For thou deſirest not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, &amp;c. The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit: a broken and a contrite heart: O God thou wilt not deſpiſe:</hi> Iſa. 66. 1, 2, 3. <hi>But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word.

Acts 5. 3. 11 The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical ſervice albeit it be not deſpiſed by men, yet God doth know it, and will make it known to others, to the ſhame of him that doth it. 1 <hi>Chr. 28. 9.

And it is not onely not accepted, but ſleighted of God, it being a grievous ſin, a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and prophanation of Gods name, it is a provocation of his wrath, and doth draw down grievous judgements upon men that doe ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. Mal. 1. 7. 13. 14. <hi>Should I accept this, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But curſed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Lev. 10. 8.

            <p>IF any now ſhall deſire and will labour for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and would know by what meanes he
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170417:167"/> may get and keepe it, and prevent hypocriſie. We anſwer by theſe following meanes. 1. Let him labour to be ſincere in his ſtate in general, for till this, it cannot be expected he ſhould do any thing in ſinceritie. 2. Let him labour to get the Spirit of God into his heart and by this to get a newheart a heart convinced of ſin by the worke of the Law. <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 10. And drawne to Chriſt by faith, and ſo to become one with him, and made a new creature, for no man can otherwiſe bee ſincere, And hee that is in Chriſt is and muſt bee ſo a new creature aſſoone as he is in him. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. And when there is a full and powerfull change of the whole man by the grace of God, then, and not till then doth he begin to be ſincere. For every mans heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is deceitfull above all things, and till God hath changed it there is no integritie in it, and a mans heart is never plaine and even till it be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by grace for till this be, a man makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the center, and all lines to meete in him.

Let him labour from the ſenſe of Gods love to him to get, and increaſe in an unfeined love to God, which will make him ſincere. Pſal. 26. 1, 2. <hi>I have walked in mine integritie, for thy loving kindnes is before mine eyes. 1 Jo. 4. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 6. 6. Let him labour much in the mortification of his luſts, and eſpecially in his luſts of coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for this inclines a man to hypocriſie.

And for the better doing and attainment of all theſe things. 1. Let him thinke much of God, his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and omniſcience, the fearefull judgements to come upon hypocrites. And let the feare of theſe judgements take hold of him Prov. 14. 2. <hi>Hee that walketh in his uprightnes feareth the Lord.</hi> 2 Sam. 22. 24. <hi>For all his judgements were before me</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was alſo upright &amp;c.</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>Know thou the God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſerve him with a perfect heart, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts &amp;c.</hi> Job. 31. 4, 23. <hi>Doth hee not ſee my wayes and count all my ſteps, Pſal.</hi> 50. 21, 22.

Soe that as <hi>Intellectus humanus</hi> is a faculty of the rationall ſoule ſpecifically diſtinct from all other faculties, comprehending under it, <hi>hunc &amp; illum intellecium.</hi> So <hi>Voluutas humana</hi> is a diſtinct faculty Or <hi>ſpecies in ordine ad hanc &amp; illam voluntatem.</hi> 2. But if by theſe words <hi>[Our underſtandings, and wills are phyſically the ſame]</hi> this be meant, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of all men in the world are ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſame, and the wills of all men in the world are ſoe too; This is granted, as evidently true. For <hi>facultas Intellectiva</hi> in all men, wiſe and fooliſh, and <hi>facultas volitiva</hi> in all men good or
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170417:171"/> bad, is ſpecifically the ſame.

Nay, not onely ſo, but the wills and underſtandings of all mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, or in hell, or heaven (even our bleſſed Saviours underſtanding &amp; will) are of the ſame <hi>ſpecies.</hi> But then. 3. It muſt be conſidered, that this makes nothing to the preſent purpoſe, nor any way proves that Common and ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Yet if the will and underſtanding were Graces, they are not capable of any degrees <hi>(Potentiae naturales non habent magis &amp; minus,</hi> is a knowne Axiome in the Schooles of Philoſophers and Divines toe) So that although the wil &amp; underſtanding of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſpecifically the ſame, yet this ſignifies nothing, but is wholy impertinent as to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <hi>Conſid.</hi> 4. When it is ſaid—<hi>Is not common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife and ſpeciall beleife, common knowledge and ſpeciall knowledge, all knowledge and beliefe? Is not beliefe the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170417:172"/> ſame thing in one and another, though but one ſaveing?</hi> I anſwere, yes: 'tis moſt certain that all beliefe is beliefe, and all knowledge is knowledge. But then. 2. <hi>Quid hoc ad Iphieli Bones?</hi> Will it hence follow, that all beliefe, and all knowledge are ſpecifically the ſame? may not all knowledge, be knowledge, and all beleife beleife, and yet knowledge and knowledge, beleife and beleife be ſpecifically diſtinct? Yes, 'tis evident they may. The demonſtrative knowledge of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and Geometry, the artificiall knowledge of a Taylor or Shoomaker, the ſupernaturall knowledge of God in Jeſus Cbriſt, wrought in the hart of true beleivers by the holy Ghoſt, all theſe (I ſay) are vinvocally knowledge, and yet I beleive none will, (ſure I am none truely can) ſay, that all theſe are ſpecifically the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and differ onely gradually. 2. But if any ſhould ſay otherwiſe, I ſhall deſire him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>1. That the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt (I mean the knowledge of him by a lively faith) wrought in the hart of a true beleiver by the holy Ghoſt, is a divine knowledge <hi>(&amp; ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne principii à quo, &amp; objecti in quod tendit)</hi> the other but humane. And I beleive none will ſay ſuch knowledges are onely gradually diſtinct: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be conſidered 1. that not onely their objects, but the principles too whence they
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170417:172"/> come, are as far different, as heaven and earth. 2. That they have far different Acts; the one being a gratious ſanctifying Act, the other not: the one ſuch as may be in any wicked perſon, nay and actually is in the Devil himſelf for I doubt not, but notwithſtanding all his badneſſe, he may be (and is) a good Mathematition) whereas the other never is, nor can be in any but a regenerate perſon. 3. Were there onely a graduall difference, then the humane, and (as is ſuppoſed) the leſſe knowledge, might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into a Divine and ſaveing knowledge, by addition of further degrees. But this is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible; for let our knowledge in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, or Arithmerique (for inſtance) be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the utmoſt, as high as there is any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of knowing thoſe objects, yet they can never come to be Divine, and ſanctifying, or ſaveing knowledge, but remain ſtill <hi>barely huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> naturall, or artificiall cognitions, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and I thinke, will not be deny'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſid.</hi> 5. When it is ſaid—<hi>That the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the will are phyſically the ſame, of the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and an Act, and an Act are Accidents of the ſame kind, and common love to God and ſpeciall love to God are acts of the ſame will.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwere. 1. That the expreſſion sin this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph are very improper and incongruous. 1. Becauſe the will and underſtanding cannot in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170417:173"/> any Philoſophicall, or Logicall propriety of ſpeech be call'd like ſubſtances, ſeing they are not ſubſtances at all, but Accidents 2. Becauſe (admit by ſubſtances their natures or eſſences be meant, yet) to ſay they are <hi>phyſically the ſame</hi> (in nature, and ſubſtance) and then in the next words, that they are of <hi>like ſubstance,</hi> is to ſay their natures are the ſame, and their natures are like one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: which is indeed to ſay things which are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and inconſiſtent. For if they be of the ſame ſubſtance and nature, then they are not of the like nature and ſubſtauce: for ſure the old rule in Logique is ſtill true, <hi>Nullum ſimile eſt idem.</hi> 3. But it being granted (as it is that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and will in ſeverall men (as in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites &amp; regenerate perſons) are not ſpecifically diſtinct, yet it neither does, nor can follow, but their acts may, and that even about the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. So the ſame man may (at ſeverall times) love God, and hate him: now (in this caſe) thoſe two Acts of love and hate are acts of a Will ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically (nay numerically) the ſame, and yet the Acts themſelves are not ſo, but ſpecifically dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: the one being an act of vertue, the other of vice, the one <hi>actus proſecutionis,</hi> the other <hi>actus fugae, &amp; averſationis;</hi> the one a fulfilling, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a violation of the law, Further. 4. I am ſure 'tis not onely a graduall difference. 1. Becauſe <hi>actus proſecutionis, &amp; fugae,</hi> differ more then gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170417:173"/> 2. Thoſe acts may be in the ſame degree, as they are phyſically conſidered, as if <hi>Titius</hi> (which is poſſible) ſhould love God in the ſame degree now, in which he hated him before: And therefore two acts of the ſame will, and degree, may be ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed, and ſo it will not follow, that becauſe the will from whence they flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſpecifically the ſame, therefore the Acts of it are ſo too. 5. The ſame may be ſaid of loveing and hateing the ſame ſin, at ſeverall times, in the ſame degree, or any volition and nolition of the ſame object, in the ſame perſon: which are acts of a will ſpecifically, (nay nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically) the ſame, and yet the Acts themſelves ſpecifically different.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſid.</hi> 6. When it is ſaid, <hi>That the Acts, and exerciſe of common and ſpeciall grace differ only in degree and ſo the difference between common and ſpeciall grace is only graduall, and not ſpecificall</hi> I conceave (with a willing, and humble ſubmiſſion to better jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements) that this poſition is not true, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the juſt, and known principles of Divinity, or true Philoſophy My reaſons for this aſſertion are theſe, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>1. I ſuppoſe actions evangelically good, and well pleaſing to God, may differ ſpecifically ſometimes: as an Act of ſaveing faith, and an Act of true charity, doe differ ſpecifically, though both of them evangelically good, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170417:174"/> well-pleaſing to God. Sometimes they may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only gradually, as haveing ſeverall degrees of perfection within the ſame ſpecies. As the leaſt meaſure and degree of true juſtifying faith, ('tis evident that ſuch faith is capable of degrees) differ from the ſtrongeſt ſaveing beleif onely in degrees. For, <hi>bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ſpecie</hi> (nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall diſtinction in this caſe come not into conſideration) cannot poſſibly differ more than gradually. But now acts of common grace in hypocrites, and irregnerate perſons differ more then ſo, from acts of ſpeciall grace in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. For 'tis certain, that <hi>Bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ſpecie,</hi> neither doe, nor can differ ſo much as <hi>Bonum &amp; malum.</hi> There being manifeſtly a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repugnancy between good and evill, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two good things onely gradually diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: theſe ſtanding in a naturall ſubordination the one to the other, the leſſer degree to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which when it comes conſiſts with the leſſe degree, and perfects it. But thoſe ſtand in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and formal oppoſition, good and evil being inconſiſtent, and naturally deſtructive of each other. As a greater, and leſſer degree of heate (in a naturall way) will agree well enough, whereas heate and cold are incompatible. Iſay <hi>bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ſpecie,</hi> differ not ſo much as <hi>bonum &amp; malum:</hi> but acts of common grace in hypocrites, and ſaveing grace in the regenerate,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170417:174"/> are ſuch: the Acts of ſaveing grace being evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically good, and well pleaſing to God, the Acts of common grace in hypocrites &amp; unregenerate perſons not ſo, being neither evangelically good, nor well pleaſing to God. For what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpeciouſneſs ſoever they may have, yet when (all circumſtances are conſidered) they are examined by the rules of the law, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, 'tis certain they are, and ever will be found onely <hi>Splendida peccata</hi> (as the Father calls them) <hi>Splendida</hi> perhaps, yet <hi>peccata,</hi> and ſo not pleaſing to God. And this ſeemes to me evident enough.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, <hi>without faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And therefore thoſe acts of common grace in hypocrites (who have not ſuch ſaving faith as the Apoſtle there ſpeakes of) are not pleaſing unto God, nor Evangelically good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hypocrites, and irregenerate perſons are not (in the ſenſe of the Goſpel) <hi>good trees,</hi> and therefore cannot bring forth gaod fruit. They are <hi>thiſtles,</hi> on which you may (in vaine) ſeeke <hi>figs,</hi> but ſhall never find any. They are crabtrees, and though they may beare a faire promiſeing fruit, which may much reſemble an apple, yet when you come to taſt, and try it, you will ſoon ſee by the ſowerneſs, 'tis no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hypocrites, and irregenerate perſons, are (if we will belive the Goſpel) in the fleſh, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded, and have not the ſpirit of Chriſt:

               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Which appeares further, becauſe while we are irrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, we are <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2. 13. Eph. 2. 1, 2, 5, 12.</note> 
               <hi>ſpiritually dead in ſins,</hi> and have no ſpirituall life (much leſs the Acts, and exerciſe of it) for that we have ſolely <note n="f" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 12. Joh. 15. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>from Christ and his ſpirit.</hi> Whence it ſeemes to me to follow, that the Acts of common grace in irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons are not, cannot be pleaſyng to God, and evangelically good: and therefore the Acts of ſaveing grace in the regenerate, being really and evangelically good, and well pleaſing to God, differ from them more then gradually.</p>
            <p>2. I deſire it may be conſidered, that is is (and upon evident reaſon) <note n="g" place="margin">M. <hi>Baxters Saints everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reſt.</hi> pag. 225.</note> confeſſed that the Acts of common and ſpeciall grace (as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered) differ ſpecifically, and not onely in degrees: whence it followes; that when the Queſtion is put, How common and ſpeciall grace differ? the Anſwere muſt ever be affirmative, that they differ <hi>Specie, Non gradu ſolum.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the Acts of the will, and underſtanding are ſaveing graces in their
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170417:175"/> moral conſideration onely, and in no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatſoever. And therefore if in their morall conſideration they ſtill differ ſpecifically from common graces, it can never (with any congruity) be affirmed, that in any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration they differ onely gradually. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when 'tis ſaid, that in their naturall, and phyſicall conſideration they differ onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. I reply, that the Acts of the will, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that conſideration, are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing graces at all; and therefore, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in that conſideration, they differ onely gradually; yet it will not thence follow, that common and ſpecial graces differ onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſuch acts of the Will, and Underſtanding, So conſidered, being no graces at all. For this Argument <hi>[common and ſpeciall beleife as they are phyſically conſidered, differ onely gradually go. Common and ſpeciall graces differ onely gradually]</hi> In plaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh is no more then this. <hi>[Things which are no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at all differ onely gradually, ergo. Common and ſpeciall graces differ onely in degrees.]</hi> Now this latter argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being an illogical <hi>nonſequitur,</hi> the former, (which is really the ſame) muſt be ſo toe. Now that thoſe Acts of the will &amp; udderſtanding (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing faith, and ſaveing love) as they are phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally conſidered, are no ſaveing graces at all, will (if I miſtake not) appeare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By what is ſaid in the ſecond conſideration above.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:170417:176"/> 2. Becauſe ſaveing love and beleife, are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and ſaveing graces onely in a morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as is confeſſed by that <note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Baxter in his Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt.</hi> pag. 226.</note> reverend, and learned perſon, againſt whoſe hypotheſis we now reaſon.

Now this is a Morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, and not naturall; for ſo it followes in that pious and Learned Author—<hi>The promiſe giveth not ſalvation to the Act conſidered in its MEERE being, and NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RALL Sincerity, but to the Act as ſuited with its object in its eſſentiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</hi> That is in plainer Engliſh, theſe Acts are not ſaveing graces in their phyſicall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in their morall, as they carry a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the precept, and promiſe. So that he that ſaith, common and ſaveing graces are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically diſtinct in their morall confideration, ſaith they are abſolutely, and onely ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, becauſe they are ſaveing graces in no conſideration but that.</p>

               <hi>Conſid</hi> 8. It is to be conſidered, that common and ſpeciall graces conſiſt not ſo properly, and primarily in the Acts, and exerciſe of faith and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170417:176"/> love <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in the habits, and principle from whence they come: So that the gratiouſneſs which is in them (as <hi>Suares,</hi> and ſome others tell us) is not, <hi>ipſis actibus originaliter intrinſeca, ſed a principio, &amp; habitu unde fluunt derivata.</hi> For inſtance, the gratiouſneſſe of our actuall faith or love doth not conſiſt ſo much in the ſubſtance, and nature of the Act phyſically conſidered, (which is the naturall product of the naturall faculty from whence it flowes) as in the circumſtance, the <hi>modus,</hi> and meaſure of it, from which its <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and conformity with the Law ariſeth, and this it hath from the principle, and habit from whence it flowes. For as the habit is more intenſe or remiſſe, more perfect or imperfect, So pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably is the Act which proceeds from it. 'Tis true, to beleive, or love, or hate (if ſimply conſidered, <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam actus)</hi> are naturall effects, and phyſicall products of our will, and underſtanding, ſuch as thoſe faculties can, (and many times doe) produce without the helpe of any habit, But if the manner, and meaſure of thoſe Acts be conſidered (that we beleive, or love <hi>modo debito,</hi> with facility, cheerfullneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy) this (in which the gratiouſneſs of the Act conſiſts) they owe to the habits, or graces ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the faculties, and naturall powers from whence they proceed.</p>
            <p>2. And as the habits are (common or ſpeciall)
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170417:177"/> graces in order of nature allways, and moſtly in order of time before the Acts (theſe being the effects of thoſe) So they are far more conſiſting, and permanent. The acts are ſo tranſitory and vaniſhing, that a little ſleepe, or ſowneing, an inadvertency of that buiſineſſe about which we are, or intention of other buiſineſſe, robbs us of them: but the habits are more fix'd and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their inherence and denomination. So that from them men are call'd (and are) truely gratious, even when they have no Act of grace to give them that denomination; otherwiſe we ſhould (when we go to ſleep) put of our graces with our clothes, &amp; he that was a gratious man now, immediately be none.</p>
            <p>Seing then that <hi>habits</hi> doe <hi>prins &amp; principalius</hi> denominate us gratious, therefore they are more properly and principally to be eſteemed (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or ſpeciall) graces: and then it ſeemes to me to follow, that he that inquires, whether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and ſpeciall graces differ ſpecifically, or onely gradually, ſhould (if he will rationally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) firſt, and principally inquire concerneing the habits of common and ſpeciall grace, and then ſecondarily concerneing the Acts, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of thoſe habits. The reaſon is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Acts have their gratiouſneſſe from the habits, but not <hi>(Viceversâ)</hi> the habits from the Acts, and go the Acts cannot poſſibly
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170417:177"/> be known diſtinctly, and <hi>a priori</hi> till we know the habits from whence thoſe Acts (as from their cauſe) doe proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe if it doe appeare that the habits differ ſpecifically, then it will evidently follow, that the Acts doe ſo too: ſeing 'tis impoſſible, that thoſe Acts ſhould differ onely gradually, which proceed from habits, ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſid.</hi> 9. So that we are now come to the prime hinge and foundation of this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to inquire how the habit of ſaveing grace differs from thoſe we call common graces? And here I ſhall give you,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Poſition.</item>
               <item>2. The proof of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Poſit.</hi> 1. The Poſition is this—The Habits of ſpeciall &amp; ſaveing grace are not only gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but ſpecifically diſtinct from the habits, and Acts of all common grace whatſoever.</p>
            <p>2. For the more methodicall, and manifeſt demonſtration of this poſition, I ſhall proceed by theſe ſteps, and degrees;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rat.</hi> 1. <hi>Principalis.</hi> 1. There are many <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graces (dona extraordinaria gratuita)</hi> which are inherent in the body, &amp; properly corporeall. As (for in ſtance) the extraordinary great ſtrength of <hi>Sampſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the beauty of <hi>Abſolom. &amp;c.</hi> Now for ſuch commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graces as theſe, I ſhall take it for granted that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170417:178"/> they differ more then onely in degree from the habits of ſaveing faith, and charyty, and ſuch other Sanctifying graces. For as no man (that I know of) did ever affirme them to be ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſame with thoſe ſpeciall graces, ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally none can. They being manifeſtly not in the ſame, but ſeverall ſpecies of Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rat.</hi> 2. There are many common graces of the Soule, which facilitate and inable us in the diſtinct knowledge, and comprehenſion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things; ſometimes immediately, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarity infuſed by God, as the great, and vaſt knowledge of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the natures of things, from the Hyſſope on the wall, to the Cedar on <hi>Libanus,</hi> (in the phraſe of Scripture.) Sometimes acquired by the helpe of naturall ingenuity, induſtry, art, and education, (with Gods bleſſing thereupon) and ſuch other naturall, and temporall advantages, as ſome have, moſt want: And of this ſort (I ſuppoſe) was the very great knowledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, which was in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Galen. &amp;c.</hi> Now ſuch knowledge as this (though a common grace) I take to be more then gradually diſtinct, from ſaveing, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying knowledge, ſuch as the knowledge of God by a lively faith enlightening, and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſoules. This I take to be evident, and therefore ſhall not go about to prove it. For as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170417:178"/> no man can (without ſtrange confidence, to ſay no worſe) ſo (I beleive) no man will deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rat.</hi> 3. Faith of miracles in a common grace, which differs from ſpeciall, and ſaveing faith more then gradually. This (I thinke) will be evident enough, to any who will (without prejudice or partiality) ſeriouſly conſider the great, and more then graduall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. for</p>
            <p n="1">1. They differ <hi>ratione Principii,</hi> the habit of ſaveing faith being ever an effect of the Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit of Chriſt workeing rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and a new life in us: the faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles not ſo. Which many times may, and <hi>de facto</hi> has been in thoſe who never had the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Spirit of Chriſt in them. I know well, (and deny not) that both theſe effects are from the ſame <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſpirit, materially and abſolutely conſidered, ſo that the ſpirit is the ſame <hi>principium materiale</hi> of both; but under a ſeverall reaſon, and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which makes them ſeverall formall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, enough to diſtinguiſh the effects that flow from them. For the giveing of ſaveing faith is an Act of the ſpirit of Chriſt within, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dwelling in his Saints: not ſo the giveing of the faith of miracles to ſinners (of which we
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170417:179"/> now ſpeake) For in the uſual phraſe of <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. John 14. 16. 17.</note> Scripture, the ſpirit is ſaid to be, and dwell in the regenerate, in ſuch a peculiar way as he is not in any wicked perſon. So that the giveing of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing faith is, <hi>actus ſpiritus internè regenerantis;</hi> the giveing of the faith of miracles, is <hi>Actus externè, gubernantis.</hi> The giveing of ſaveing faith is an Act of ſpeciall love to that perſon to whom ſuch faith is given; but the giveing of miraculous faith to wicked men (for to ſuch it is many times given) is an Act of his love to others, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuch perſon to whom it is given.

            <p>2. Further, if ſaveing faith and that of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles differ onely in degree, or as a diſpoſition and an Habit, then I demand which is the Habit, and the higher degree? If it be ſaid that ſaveing faith is the higher degree, and ſo the Habit, and faith of miracles the lower degree, as a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: then it evidently followes, that who ever has juſtifying faith has that of Miracles too; (which is manifeſtly untrue) for 'tis certaine (and will not be deny'd by any who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Philoſophy, or Scholaſticall Divinity) that when two Qualities differ onely in degree, then that in the higher degree intrinſecally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that in the lower degree (and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence all the vertue, and natural or moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of it) ſo an habit neceſſarily includes the diſpoſition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if they had not that power before (as moſt certainely they had not, ſeeing it was
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170417:183"/> given them then) then faith of miracles is not included in ſaveing faith as the leſſe degree. If it be ſaid that faith of miracles is the higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as an habit, (which onely remaines to be ſaid by him who holds they differ onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) &amp; ſo includes juſtifying faith as the lower degree, and a diſpoſition; then whoever has the faith of miracles, has ſaveing faith too, which is evidently untrue: as may appeare by what is above ſaid, and indeed is confeſſed (as of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it muſt) by all ſober Divines, (who for ends, and intereſt, are not reſolved upon their Concluſions, in deſpite of Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, out of which number I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <note n="a" place="margin">

If a temporary faith, or Hiſtoricall, (ſuch as Hypocrites, and Devils themſelves may have) and ſuch common graces of knowledge (either in naturall, civil, or ſacred things) were (as is pretended) diſpoſitions to ſaveing faith; then it were rationall to thinke, that ſuch perſons ſo qualified, and diſpoſed, ſhould generally, &amp; with more facility be converted and prove reall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

In our Saviours time, few of the Phareſies, and learned Rabbies imbraced the Ghoſpell (who yet knew much more of the word of God, of the Divinity, and ſenſe of the whole law, and of the promiſes which concerned the Meſſias, then the common people did.

               <hi>Rat.</hi> 5. <hi>Princip.</hi> Itis a knowne, and receaved principle in Schoole Divinity, and Philoſophy too, that Habits are diſtinguiſhed ſpecifically by their formal objects.

Now although common and ſaveing faith may (at leaſt in <note n="a" place="margin">For ſaveing faith beleives diverſe things, which Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites by their common faith neither doe nor can (upon any iuſt ground) beleive.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170417:199"/> the <hi>formalis tendentia, &amp; habitudo utriuſque Habitus ad hoc objectum,</hi> is different, and <hi>ergo.</hi> The Habits more then gradually diſtinct. Now the different <hi>tendentia &amp; habitudo</hi> which common and ſaveing faith have to their objects, is taken from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>mediums,</hi> and motives induceing ſuch aſſent. For inſtance, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God, that he dyed, roſe againe, aſcended into heaven. &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Concluſions are beleived to be Divine truthes both by common and ſaveing faith, but upon far different, <hi>mediums,</hi> and motives. The common faith is built upon humane <hi>mediums,</hi> and arguments, ſuch as the natural underſtandings of irregenerate perſons (helped with learneing, education, and Induſtry) may attaine unto, which have no abſolute certainty, and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in them, and ſo muſt (of neceſſity) beget an aſſent proportionable to themſelves, that is, uncertaine and fallible. But ſaveing faith is built upon better principles, as proceeding from the Spirit of Chriſt, and being built upon his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate illumination and teſtimony, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently divine, and infallible: and ſo begets an aſſent of faith (like the cauſe, and principle from whence it comes) divine, and infallible. Now this latter aſſent muſt of neceſſity differ from the former more then in degrees. Now I beleive that no ſober, and intelligent perſon, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Philoſophy, and Metaphyſiques, will ſay
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170417:200"/> that an aſſent which is humane, dubious, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, differs onely gradually from an aſſent which is divine, and moſt infallibly certaine, as proceeding from, (and relying immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of) the regenerateing Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the further explication of this, take this Inſtance. This concluſion <hi>[Omnis homo habet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam Intellectivam]</hi> is the ſame material object of <hi>Science</hi> (properly ſo call'd) and <hi>Opinion,</hi> but formally different. So that thoſe. 2.

               <hi>mediums</hi> produceing ſuch aſſents. For he that aſſents to this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>[Omnis homo habet potentiam In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectivam] per medium neceſſarium, &amp; demonſtrativum,</hi> his aſſent (like the <hi>medium</hi> which produces it) is neceſſary and ſcientifical. But he that aſſents <hi>per medium probabile</hi> onely, his aſſent (proportionable to the <hi>medium</hi> which inferres it) is onely probable, and opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. So that although that <hi>Concluſion</hi> be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſcience and opinion too, and be materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſame, yet it is formally a different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, from whence ariſeth not only a gradual,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170417:200"/> but a formall and ſpecificall difference between <hi>ſcience</hi> and <hi>opinion.</hi> For many probable <hi>mediums</hi> may diſpoſe to an higher probability, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an habituall, and more firme opinion; but all the probable <hi>mediums</hi> in the world can never produce ſcience, a neceſſary and infallible aſſent, that being an aſſent of a higher (not degree onely but) nature, which no argument leſſe then demonſtrative, can poſſibly produce.</p>
            <p>So that as <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>ſcience,</hi> though about the ſame concluſion, are Habits ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and knowne and confeſſed to be ſo, by reaſon of the different <hi>mediums</hi> which produce ſuch aſſents: ſo likewiſe are <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſaveing</hi> faith more then gradually different, by reaſon of the ſeveral <hi>mediums,</hi> and motives, which are the Premiſſes and foundations upon which thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents are built, and conſtitute their objects in a ſeveral formality and habitude in relation to thoſe Aſſents. To bring all this home to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe: I grant, that common, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veingly beleiveing Chriſtians may beleive theſe, (and ſuch like) concluſions <hi>[Chriſt dyed for us, ſatisfyed Gods juſtice, interceeds for us with his Father. &amp;c.]</hi> to be divine truthes. 2 But they can have no greater aſſurance of the divine truth of theſe concluſions, then they have of the <hi>mediums,</hi> and premiſſes which inferre them. 3. Hypocrites, and impious perſons who may have common faith,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170417:201"/> have no premiſſes to inferre them, but ſuch as are humane, and dubious, at leaſt not abſolutely infallible, that is they have onely Topicall, and probable arguments, ſuch as the authority of their teachers, of councells, Fathers, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be ſaid they have Scripture for them; I reply, that the ſame Queſtion returnes: what <hi>mediums,</hi> and motives have they to beleive that to be Gods word? for their aſſent to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth of Gods word, can be no firmer, and certaine, then the premiſſes which inferre that aſſent. Now Hypocrites neither have, (nor can have) any premiſſes, or motives to beleive the Divinity of that word, but ſuch as I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is Topical, and probable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>ergo</hi> their aſſent (proportionable to thoſe motives) muſt (of neceſſity) be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and opinative.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, regenerate perſons, who are borne of God, and have true ſaveing faith, have ſurer, and more infallible principles which induce them to beleive and know the divine truth of thoſe concluſions. For beſides all thoſe inducements which Hypocrites have, they have the inward teſtimony of the Spirit of God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing witneſſe to thoſe truthes. That this may appeare, I ſay.</p>

So that ſaveing faith in regenerate perſons rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the inward teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt (which common beleivers have not) a Divine and Infallible Teſtimony their faith muſt of neceſſity differ from the faith of Hypocrites more then onely in degree. <gap reason="foreign">

If ſaveing and common grace be eſſentially the ſame, then irregenerate, and impious perſons (who may, and many times have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces) might be call'd (and indeed were) as truely gracions, and as truely beleivers as the beſt Saints, and Sonns of God, although not in ſo high a degree. For (by this hypotheſis againſt which we now diſpute) they have as true faith and grace, as regenerate perſons themſelves: ſeeing <hi>common</hi> in the wicked, and <hi>ſpeciall</hi> grace in the regenerate are (by this hypotheſis) eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſame. For as the ſmalleſt wire of good gold, is as truely gold as the whole wedge, though not ſo much; and as a body hot in the ſecond, or third degree, is as truely hot, as that which has heate in the 6. or 8. degree. So, if common grace in hypocrites, and ſaveing grace in the Saints, be eſſentially the ſame, then ſuch impious perſons (for common grace may be in ſuch) may be juſtly call'd as true beleivers, and as truely gratious, as the moſt regenerate perſons in the world.
