            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Having had cau≈øe my ≈øelfe to ≈øu≈øpect mine own condition, have been put to ≈øearch &amp; try my ≈øelf, and not willing to bee mi≈øtaken in a point of ≈øo high concernment, I did lay and bind up together the≈øe Meditations (tending to the anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and the turning of the in≈øide outward of a Chri≈øtian) to be as a Looking-gla≈øs or Touch≈øtone for my help herein. And finding them ≈øomewhat u≈øefull for mine own purpo≈øe, and ≈øuppo≈øing they may be ≈øo al≈øo to ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in my ca≈øe; And having vehement cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect, that many thou≈øands among≈øt us in this golden time, go with the wind and tyde in the general profe≈ø≈øion of the Go≈øpel, and know not (becau≈øe they try not) what they are, or whither they are going, or what they doe: Therefore I have ≈øent it amongst you as a watch-word. And now con≈øider, were there any one among≈øt you to have a goodly Mannor in a remote country for which
<pb facs="tcp:170417:3"/> he hath a conveyance for the payment down of a little ≈øum of money, and is to go ≈øhortly thither to ≈øhew his conveyance, pay his mony, and take his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: And ≈øhould I tell him his couveyance hath a flaw in it, and this is to be helpen before he go, and that the mony he iutends to carry will not pa≈øs for currant there; will he not be willing to hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advice from me? To this purpo≈øe is all this that I am ≈øaying; That your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as it now stands is not good for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the money you intend to carry with you, that you have to lay down for Chri≈øt, will not be taken for currant there. If I ≈øhould tell any of you that are trading with your whole ≈øtock, whether you ≈øhall thrive or not, or that you are in the way to be undone, and how you may thrive and be exceeding rich: Or if I ≈øhould tell you that are now going a voyage by Sea in a Ship, wherein you adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your lives and all your e≈øtate in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous pa≈ø≈øage between Rocks and Sands: Or you that are going about a work of mighty concernment, in a journey by land, in a ≈øoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way, where are Robbers, Lyons, Bears, Wolves, Brakes, Pits, &amp;c. and there is but
<pb facs="tcp:170417:3"/> one way of ≈øafety onely, and that you are in the dangerous way, and ≈øhould offer to put you in the ≈øafe way: Or if I ≈øhould tell any of you that ≈øtand to be cho≈øen to a place of Preferment, that the having of it will make him, and the lo≈øing of it will undoe him, that he is out of the way for it, and which way hee may be ≈øure of it, who would not hearken to me? How acceptable would my conu≈øel be to ≈øuch? My de≈øign therfore in this word of Advice is, to ≈øhew you how among≈øt all your gettings you may get wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 4. 7.</note>, and in your trading pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe that incomparable Pearl, which to get with the lo≈øs of all is an incomparble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 45, 46, 47.</note>; and to put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the narrow way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, which ≈øo few find, and ≈øo many are mi≈øtaken in, who then would not but hearken to it? who would but be at the co≈øt and pains to buy and read it? And now if any one by the reading hereof ≈øhall find him≈øelf to be mi≈øtaken and out of the right way, it will be his advantage to be guided into it: It is better to run again than to run ami≈øs, <note place="margin">Melius e≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere quam male currere.</note> and to beginne all again than to
<pb facs="tcp:170417:4"/> end that which being ended will be to no purpo≈øe. And for others that are in the right way, albeit they may be hereby ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what affrighted and ≈øhaken, yet it <note place="margin">Bonum e≈øt timere.</note> will make to their fa≈øter ≈øettlement at la≈øt.

               <p>Sincerity is that holy Frame of ≈øoule, wrought in it by Gods ≈øpirit, whereby the ≈øoule ≈øtands right to God in its purpo≈øe and endeavour to under≈øtand his mind from his word, that thereby it may exactly plea≈øe him in all things which he requireth therein.

            </div>
            <div type="subsection">
               <head>The Nature of Sincerity.</head>
               <p>To open this a little. This Sincerity lieth within: it is a heart work, or bu≈øine≈ø≈øe in the Soule, wherein the ≈øpirit of God doth dwell.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170417:10"/> And therefore it is ≈øet forth in Scripture by the Metaphor of the Root of a Tree, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. or <hi>Foundation</hi> of a building, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24. It is a frame of the heart, it ≈øpreads it ≈øelfe through the whole heart or Soule, under≈øtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, will, and affections. And there is an habitualne≈ø≈øe, and con≈øtant tenor and temper in it. And it is ≈øuch a thing, as like a ≈øpring that runs, it ≈øtreams &amp; makes them reli≈øh of it: doth run into all the motions and operations of the Soule and body, called by one the proper quality of our obedience (if it may be ≈øaid to be a grace of it ≈øelfe, and not a thing that doth mingle it ≈øelfe with all graces, and (as one calls it) the Spirituall tune of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Soule) it is then certainly a grace made up of many ≈øpirituall and choyce graces, like as was the holy oyle powred on the head and garments of the High-Prie≈øts, compounded and made up of many precious Ingredients. For it mu≈øt ≈øpring from the new life of the new Creature (the Soule whereof is Chri≈øt) which hath within it, and mu≈øt include Faith, love, and the re≈øt of the Graces that accompany ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For it mu≈øt flow from the pure and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven workings of the internall Principles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ends. And therefore if a man act never ≈øo much in duties, and have not a divine Spirituall Spring, a heart impul≈øed, and moved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170417:11"/> by Gods ≈øpirit acting in it: If there be not an acting of all the graces together in a harmony purely and really towards God, this Sincerity is not there. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We call it the work of the Spirit, and, ≈øo it mu≈øt needs be, for as the naturall life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ≈øprings from the Soule within; ≈øo all the life of grace in the Soule, ≈øprings from the ≈øpirit of Chri≈øt within the Soule. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 63.</p>
               <p>We ≈øay the work begins with a mind ≈øaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned by the Word and Spirit of God. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 36. 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. For without knowledge the heart cannot be good, and without this there can be no Faith, no foundation of any Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor any thing wherein, or whereby it may ≈øhew it ≈øelfe. And therefore when the Apo≈øtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. 10. prayeth for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they might be ≈øincere, he begins with this, <hi>And thus I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgement, that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be ≈øincere &amp;c.</hi> So that the Sincere Chri≈øtian is not only true, cordiall and reall in what he thinketh, ≈øaith and doth, but that which he thinketh, ≈øaith and doth, is generally according to the truth of the Go≈øpell, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. And, <hi>as many as walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, &amp;c. 3 Ioh. 4. 2 Ioh. 3. 4. I rejoyced greatly that I found of thy Children walking in truth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170417:11"/> as we have received a commandement, &amp;c. Coll.</hi> 1. 13 2, 3, 4. 5. For otherwi≈øe, let what will be done, and let a man act in what he doth never ≈øo much <hi>ex animo</hi> from his very heart, and ≈øincerely according to the light he hath received (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe upon fal≈øe Principles) yet may he be called an Hypocrite.</p>

               <head>The Nature of Hypocri≈øie:</head>
               <p>But to open this Hypocri≈øie, and the nature of it, and to ≈øhew who we mean by this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; we are to know fir≈øt of all: that Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øy ≈øtands in oppo≈øition to the Truth and reality of a thing, and it ≈øtands al≈øo in oppo≈øition to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170417:13"/> the Sincerity of a mans intention in the thing, and ≈øo Hypocri≈øy may be with reference to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the≈øe. 2. By the Hypocrite in generall we doe not intend one that appears wor≈øe then he is indeed, as <hi>Peter</hi> did when he denied his Lord' (which yet he did not without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri≈øy, being ≈øo well acquainted with him) Nor by the Hypocrite doe we intend, one that acts this part for once, or is deceitfull in one thing as <hi>Peter,</hi> and ≈øome others with him were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 14. And as the be≈øt men ≈øometimes may be, and are unfainedly ≈øorry for the ≈øame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Nor doe we intend by the Hypocrite in generall, ≈øuch a man, as by humane frailty only falleth into le≈ø≈øer ≈øinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 19 For in many things we offend all, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. <hi>And there is not a man that liveth, and ≈øinneth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 47. 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5. Nor doe we hereby intend him, that by ≈øtrength of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may fall into greater ≈øinnes again≈øt his purpo≈øe, whereof he doth afterwards repent, as <hi>David, Solomon, Peter,</hi> and others did, and the be≈øt of Gods own people may doe. For as a man may be in ≈øome Acts without Hypocri≈øie, and yet be an Hypocrite: ≈øo a man may be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall in ≈øome Acts, and yet be ≈øincere; and there is ≈øome Hypocri≈øie in the be≈øt, who at one time or other, or in ≈øome things, may appeare better then they are.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170417:13"/>
               <p>3. But by the Hypocrite we meane him, that is an Hypocritie through his heart and life, one that for holine≈ø≈øe and goodne≈ø≈øe, ≈øeems to others, and perhaps al≈øo to him≈øelfe, to be what he is not, but yet ought to be; or one that de≈øires to make a faire ≈øhew without, of that goodne≈ø≈øe and holine≈ø≈øe, which he hath not, nor any root or foundation of, within him. He is one that ≈øeems to be, and to act the part of a true Chri≈øtian, but is none; he appears in the ≈øhape of a living Chri≈øtian, but is dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Thou hast a name to live, but art dead. Rom.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>He is not a Iew that is one outwardly.</hi> He doth ≈øeem to be a Saint or Angell of Light, and is a Devill, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 70. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. Hence it is that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are compared to Tares, which are like to Wheat <hi>Matth</hi> 13. 25. As Hypocri≈øie is compared to Leaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 1. which cannot be known by ≈øight, ≈øo the Hypocrite is compared to a wolfe in a ≈øheeps skin: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. For the likenes and agreement that is in appearance between him and the true Chri≈øtian, for they are indeed very hardly to be known the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the Hypocrite having ≈øomething done upon, and in him, like to the work of Regenaration wrought upon, and in the elect of God, he calleth him≈øelfe, and is called by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the name of them that are regenerate, 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Being borne againe, not of corruptible ≈øeed,

Fal≈øe Apo≈øtles, and fal≈øe Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. And as they are among≈øt, ≈øo they are ≈øaid to be of the people of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2 18, 19. The Hypocrite he looks a great deale better then he is, he promi≈øeth much more then he doth performe, for his be≈øt ≈øide is without, <hi>Mat:</hi> 6. 2. 23. 27. 26. 14. 15. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. He is like to an Apple, all faire without but quite rotten within. But the be≈øt ≈øide of the Sincere man is within, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 45. 13. <hi>He is all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within, Cant.</hi> 1. 5. Or he is the ≈øame within and without, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. <hi>His mouth ≈øpeaketh wi≈ødome, &amp;c. The Law of God is in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is that the Hypocrite is compared to a painted Sepulchre or wall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 3. To a Cloud without water, carried about with every wind, <hi>Iud.</hi> 12. which notes his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy, for he is un≈øtable in all his wayes, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 8. And to a wandring ≈øtarre. <hi>Iude</hi> 13. that makes as faire a ≈øhew, and promi≈øes as much by its influences, as the fixed ≈øtarre doth. So he ≈øeems to promi≈øe much to God and Man, and performes nothing, makes a faire ≈øhew for a time, and then vani≈øheth away, and comes to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170417:14"/> nothing, <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Your goodne≈ø≈øe is as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clowd, and as the early dew it goeth away, Mat.</hi> 13. Hence it is he is compared in Scripture, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Bow, <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 7. 16. and in our common compari≈øon, to Rowers in the Boat, whiles in their pretence they look one way, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents they goe the clean contrary way; or like to an Eagle that ≈øoars high towards Heaven, that he may have the more advantage upon his prey upon the Earth, on which his eye is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

In the Simulation of good, that he may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and feigne that which indeed is not, that he may make ≈øhew of that good which he hath not at all, or el≈øe not in that mea≈øure he maketh ≈øhew of, being e≈øpecially ≈øwayed with the ≈øini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter re≈øpects of gaine and glory: And ≈øo his main ≈øtudy is, that he may ≈øeem better then he is, and that he may ≈øeem to doe better then he doth.</p>
               <p>2. In Di≈ø≈øimulation, which is either of evill or of good, in di≈ø≈øembling and concealing that which indeed is evill; ≈øo his maine care is, that he may not appeare to be ≈øo bad as he is, and to doe ≈øo bad as he doth. And this di≈ø≈øembling and concealing of evill, is threefold. 1. Of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170417:15"/> in doing, he hideth that which he is in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a pretence of doing the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So <hi>Herod</hi> his intent of the Murther, with pretence of the wor≈øhip of Chri≈øt; <hi>Ab≈øalon</hi> his Trea≈øon, with the Religion of a vow; <hi>Iudas</hi> his Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, with the ≈øhew of liberality to the poore; and the Jewes their envy to Chri≈øt, with a ≈øhew of duty to Cae≈øar 2. He di≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth that which he is about to doe. So <hi>Haman E≈øter</hi> 5. 10. refrained him≈øelfe, and concealed his malice and mi≈øchiefe intended to the Jewes. And the <hi>Gibeonites, Io≈øh.</hi> 9. 4. 3. He laboureth to conceale that which is already done, as the Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 19, 20. 2. The di≈ø≈øembling of good is when we conceale and ≈ømother the good that is in us, for ≈øome advantage to our ≈øelves. So the Corinthians 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 19. went to the Jews fea≈øts for the company of their friends. And ≈øo <hi>Peter</hi> did Judaize, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. out of feare to offend, &amp; de≈øire to plea≈øe other men. So that we ≈øay, that he is an Hypocrite not only that makes a ≈øeeming outward ≈øhew of what he hath not, but al≈øo that hath a true ≈øhew of what indeed there is not. The ≈øin of the Hypocrite is therefore not a ≈øin of infirmity but a ≈øinne of malignity, perver≈øene≈ø≈øe &amp; contempt.</p>

               <p>Of the ≈øeverall kinds of Hypocri≈øy and Sincerity. And of the Severall ≈øorts of Hypocrites.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HYpocri≈øie, and ≈øo Sincerity al≈øo (as to the kinds thereof) are con≈øiderable in men diver≈øe wayes. 1. In reference to the man in whom it is in generall, as it re≈øpects his heart in what he doth, whether he be rotten or ≈øound therein, So Chri≈øt calleth the Phari≈øes Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. often. 2. With reference to the matter wherein it is acted and ≈øheweth it ≈øelfe. And ≈øo it is con≈øiderable al≈øo, Either in relation to the inward affections and motions of the heart; or the words of the mouth; or the works of the hands: It is con≈øiderable, as to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and motions of the heart within, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be indeed, as they ≈øeem to be in ≈øhew,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170417:18"/> by the words and works without. For a man may pretend to true Faith, Love, Repentance, and other Graces and works of the Spirit, whereof there may be ≈øome appearance or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe upon him, and which he may think he hath in truth within him, but hath it not indeed, nor any thing, but the picture and Image thereof only. For there are ≈øome things like to that are not ≈øaving Graces: and there is no ≈øaving Grace in truth in a Saint, but there may be and is, the likene≈ø≈øe of it in an Hypocrite. There are naturall gifts and works ari≈øing from the naturall con≈øtitution and temper of a man. And ≈øo a man may be naturally meeke, loving, kind, mercifull, curteous and peaceable. There may be, and are many very commendable qualities wrought in a man by Education, reading, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and the like. And hereby ≈øome have attained to virtues like to ≈øaving Graces. And there are Spirituall Gifts, or common operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ≈øpirit of God, di≈øtinct from ≈øaving grace which is called unfeighned grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 37. The grace of Gods Elect, and Grace which doth accompany Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9. And ≈øo a man may have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any ≈øaving Grace, and yet not have the Grace it ≈øelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27, 28. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 78. 36, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21, 23. <hi>P≈øal:</hi> 136. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Exod:</hi> 14. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. 2. Hypocri≈øie and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170417:18"/> Sincerity al≈øo, are con≈øiderable as to the words whether they be ≈øo in the intention of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, in them≈øelves, and may produce the effect they doe <hi>prima facie,</hi> ≈øeeme to be and to produce. Or they be not lyes ≈øpoken in Hypocri≈øie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. and dangerous Errors under glorious pretences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. The≈øe things are con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as to workes. And this not only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a work really done from his heart that doth it, but that it be ≈øuch a work as is good and ought to be done. And ≈øo Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie and Sincerity are con≈øiderable in relation to all the actings of a mans whole life, as that of <hi>Amaziah</hi> 2 Chron. 25, 2. Scribes and Phari≈øes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and others 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 62. Or to ≈øome particular actings of a mans life; as that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 34. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 48. 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 12. 38. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 19. 10. Hypocri≈øy al≈øo (as to the work) may be ≈øaid to be either expre≈ø≈øe; which is either where the thing done is, being a good thing and commanded by God, is done, either again≈øt the heart, or not with the whole heart, or to a good, but to a ≈øini≈øter end. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Phill.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. 23, 22. <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 7. 16. Or it is Implicite and interpretative. And ≈øo are all the glorious works of Piety, Mercy, Charity, and Ju≈øtice done by the Profe≈ø≈øor of Religion, by men out of Chri≈øt, and without Faith, though done with never ≈øo much ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170417:19"/> integrity, ≈øeeing they are not of faith, without which it is impo≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe God. For as the works are but <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ≈øinnes, ≈øo are they in ≈øome degree more or le≈ø≈øe done in Hypocri≈øie, and they Hypocrites that doe them, 1 <hi>King</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29 <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 29. And all the≈øe things thus done in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri≈øie, as before in any ≈øort, are oppo≈øed to the ≈øincere obedience of the Faithfull, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 10. 2 Kings 23. 25. 2 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. <hi>Jer</hi> 24. 7. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 29. 13. Of ≈øuch Hypocrites as we have ≈øpoken of, that are rotten at heart, there are diver≈øe ≈øorts. There are Hypocriticall Nations (that is) ≈øuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as live not up to their Profe≈ø≈øion. Such was the Jewi≈øh Nation, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 10. 6. And ≈øuch is any Nation now profe≈ø≈øing the Chri≈øtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that live not becoming Chri≈øtians. And there are Hypocriticall per≈øons. And among≈øt the≈øe Hypocriticall <note place="margin">The Gro≈ø≈øe Hypocritie.</note> Per≈øons. There are Gro≈ø≈øe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and Refined Hypocrites. The Gro≈ø≈øe Hypocrite is al≈øo either more Gro≈ø≈øe, or le≈ø≈øe Gro≈ø≈øe, yet both of them are very gro≈ø≈øe. The more gro≈ø≈øe is one that either doth notoriou≈øly di≈ø≈øemble again≈øt his own light, in what he doth of purpo≈øe to cheat and deceive others. The le≈ø≈øe Gro≈ø≈øe is one who doth maintain ≈øome gro≈ø≈øe Errors, or live in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170417:19"/> ≈øome gro≈ø≈øe practi≈øe of Sinne. There are Hypocrites in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">The Nature of his Hypocri≈øie.</note> and Hypocrites in Action. The Hypocrite in Opinion we call him that pretendeth to Truth of opinion, to hold forth the very truths of God out of love unto them, and yet maintaineth Error and Here≈øie. And the Hypocrite in Action we call him that pretendeth to holine≈ø≈øe of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>formity to Gods will, without in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation, where he hath no inward and hearty affection thereunto. And both the≈øe are either more gro≈ø≈øe or more refined. The more gro≈ø≈øe Hypocrite in Opinion, is one who maketh a great ≈øhew outwardly, of holding forth Gods Truth, where he is inwardly in his heart, ≈øuch an enemy to it, that he ≈øpreadeth abroad his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and this he doth knowingly, and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to deceive. So it is more then probable did the Phari≈øes in ≈øome of their opinions, which they could not but know to be Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. So ≈øome of the Gno≈øticks of old, taught a lawfulne≈ø≈øe in Chri≈øtians, to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by a Go≈øpell liberty, and to deny Chri≈øt in ca≈øe of per≈øecution, to ≈øave them≈øelves from death. So Papi≈øts and other Hereticks now, who teach unlawfulnes of marriages of meats, and other ≈øuch like things, contrary to the clear evidence of the word. The≈øe no doubt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170417:20"/> (many of them) did and doe know that they did and doe maintain Errors and Here≈øies, and yet they did and doe continue to maintain them for ≈øome advantage to them≈øelves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Speaking lyes in Hypocri≈øie.</hi> The more Gro≈ø≈øe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in Action or practi≈øe, is he that a≈ø≈øume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a forme of Godline≈ø≈øe, and pretends to a for≈øaking of ≈øinne and infidelity, by Faith and Repentance within him, when he hath only the ≈øhew, and appearance thereof. And he neither hath nor intendeth, or de≈øireth to have, or doe any ≈øuch thing, and knoweth he doth di≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and doth it of purpo≈øe to deceive others thereby. This indeed is an Hypocrite in graine, or an Hypocrite in the highe≈øt degree, when a man ≈øhall pretend to the Truth of Religion, and doth make it his whole de≈øigne, trade, or work, therein to act Hypocri≈øie only. Such a one is ≈øaid to be a Cheator or Juglor, that ≈øheweth tricks, and maketh appearances of things that really are not ≈øo as they appeare; the ≈øame word in the originall, it is ≈øaid, ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for both. And he is compared to a per≈øon di≈øgui≈øed, or a Stage-player, who in the ≈øight of others, may act the part of a King, or hone≈øt man, but when he is in his tyring hou≈øe, is but a ba≈øe varlet, and he knowes him≈øelfe to be ≈øo. And ≈øuch an Hypocrite the Devill is, that ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appears like an Angell of light, that he

The le≈ø≈øe Gro≈ø≈øe Hypocrite, we call him that is a gro≈ø≈øe Heretick or Idolater, as a Papi≈øt, Arrian, and the like, or one that together with his profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very loo≈øe in his conver≈øation, as tho≈øe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1. 1, 2. &amp;c. and 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4, 5.

So many a man in the profe≈ø≈øion of the Go≈øpell, and his carriage with-out pretends to truth of Grace within, where there is ≈øomething like it, and he doth judge it to be there in Truth, and that he is not an Hypocrite but upright. And it is not to be doubted but that a man may be an Hypocrite, and not know it. He may doe all things according to the letter of the word right in appearance, and as to the reality of what he doth in Truth, and be hereupon per≈øwaded, that he hath grace in his heart in uprightne≈ø≈øe, is in the favour of God, and in a happy and ≈øafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate, and ≈øo continue to his dying day, and yet be damned at la≈øt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>There is a way that ≈øeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the wayes of death, Prov.</hi> 30, 12. <hi>There is a generation that are Pure in their own eyes, and yet not wa≈øhed from their filthine≈ø≈øe.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>The fooli≈øh Virgins.

And yet they were Hypocrites, and ≈øo are all ≈øuch as ≈øhall doe likewi≈øe, as many doe at this day, who pretend to be true Chri≈øtians and Saints, &amp;c. And doe make a profe≈ø≈øion of that, and doe appeare to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170417:22"/> others and them≈øelves, to be ≈øuch as they are not, for they would be thought to be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, and yet have not the Soule of a true Chri≈øtian within them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>For he is not a Iew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumci≈øion, which is outward in the fle≈øh.

            </p>
            <p>The le≈ø≈øe refined Hypocrite we call him that po≈ø≈øibly may either hold ≈øome more gro≈ø≈øe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as ≈øome Super≈øtitious. Per≈øons that are only Popi≈øh in ≈øome points, or ≈øome wor≈øe practi≈øes, or are not ≈øo exact in their lives as the former ≈øort. And yet perhaps may be ≈øecure, and judge them≈øelves in an e≈øtate good enough, Ia. 1. 25. 26 So that we call them more or le≈ø≈øe Gro≈ø≈øe, as there is more of their wills and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes, by de≈øigne in their Profe≈ø≈øion, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out≈øide of good to device, Or as their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill opinions and practi≈øes they hold or doe, are more or le≈ø≈øe evill. And more or le≈ø≈øe Refined as they are more or le≈ø≈øe privy to their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtake and deceit; or as the opinions or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes they hold or act, are more or le≈ø≈øe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. This difference of Hypocrites, the Apo≈øtle ≈øeems to hold forth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Acts 3. 17.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170417:22"/> 
               <hi>I did it ignorantly.</hi> ≈øo that there is a ≈øimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as well as a willfull knowing Hypocrite. The fir≈øt ≈øort of the≈øe Hypocrites deceive others only. But the latter ≈øort, deceive them≈øelves al≈øo, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 21, 26. <hi>If any ≈øeem to be Religious &amp;c. that deceiveth his own heart, &amp;c.</hi> So the fooli≈øh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that were never di≈øordered by the wi≈øe nor them≈øelves till the gate of grace was ≈øhut upon them. Some make a third ≈øort of Hypocrite between the two forenamed ones, and make him ≈øuch a one that doth ≈øomewhat ≈øu≈øpect him≈øelfe, and yet for ≈øome ≈øelfe ends continues and bears up in his profe≈ø≈øion as long as he can.</p>
            <p>And among≈øt the≈øe diver≈øe ≈øorts of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, there are found the≈øe differences. Or they may be di≈øtingui≈øhed thus. 1. There is a malitious or ≈øpitefull Hypocrite, and he is ≈øuch a one as doth hate and maligne the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian, and will doe to him all the mi≈øchiefe he can. And this is ≈øuch a one as for this, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Viper or Serpent, for his venome and mi≈øchiefe again≈øt, and danger to the true Church. And ≈øuch were the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 24. and 23. 33. <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 70. and 8. 44. called therefore Gods enemies, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 109. 4, 29. and 79. 26. 14. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 56. 6. <hi>your Brethren that hate you &amp;c.</hi> 2. There is a loo≈øe or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe Hypocrite, one that together with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170417:23"/> of Religion, is very licentious and loo≈øe in his conver≈øation. Such were tho≈øe in <hi>E≈øay</hi> 1. 1, 10, 11, 12. &amp;c. and tho≈øe in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 3. There is a ≈øtrict or an exact Hypocrite, one that for his outward conver≈øation is as faire, and looks as beautifull as the mo≈øt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chri≈øtian, but is rotten within. Such were the Fooli≈øh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Mat:</hi> 22. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob:</hi> But it may be objected. That we call him an Hypocrite, that doth what he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and from his heart, which is no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø:</hi> 1. We grant that men may be and are in their hearts within, oft times in that which is evill in opinion and practi≈øe, the ≈øame as they are in their profe≈ø≈øion and appearance without. So we find in <hi>Pauls</hi> ca≈øe, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 9. <hi>I verily thought with my≈øelfe that I ought to doe many things again≈øt the name of Ie≈øus, &amp;c</hi> &amp; Chri≈øt tells his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Io.</hi> 16. 2. that the time was coming, that who≈øoever ≈øhould kill them, ≈øhould think they did God ≈øervice in it. And we are per≈øwaded that mo≈øt of the Common people, under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious formes of Religion in the≈øe times, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts, Quakers, and the like, are cordiall, and doe take them≈øelves to be in the right. But 2. If we ≈øay to this farther, that a man may doe many things well, and (in his own judgement
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170417:23"/> and opinion) according to the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpell of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and yet the per≈øon ≈øo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ≈øo farre from being a Sincere good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian, that he is (all the while) a de≈øperate ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and (in that ≈øen≈øe we now ≈øpeak of) an Hypocrite. So it was with S. <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 23. 1. where he ≈øaith, <hi>I have lived in all good Con≈øcience before God untill this day.</hi> His meaning is, though he had fiercely per≈øecuted the Servants of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, yet he thought he did well, his con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (though erring) concurring with him, ≈øo that he ≈øinned not again≈øt his con≈øcience, but acted according to that light which was in him, even then when he ≈øinned again≈øt the Law of God and the Go≈øpell. 3. A thing may be done truly as to the reallity of it, but not truly as to the formality of it, Hypocri≈øie therefore is ≈øaid to lye in two things, or to be con≈øidered two wayes. 1. As it ≈øtands in oppo≈øition to the truth and reality of a thing. 2. As it ≈øtands in oppo≈øition to the Sincerity of a mans inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the thing. A man out of Chri≈øt is not a Chri≈øtian indeed, no more then a dead corps without a Soule is a man. And that he doth, let him doe it never ≈øo really and cordially, cannot be good, becau≈øe he that dot it, is evill <hi>Gen:</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Mat:</hi> 12. 33. And if the thing to be done be evill, let it be done never ≈øo cordially and really, it cannot be good. And the thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170417:24"/> done, albeit it be for the manner well done as to the reality and intention, yet if the thing done be in the matter, and in its own nature evill, it cannot be good, a thing al≈øo that in its own nature is good, may yet for the manner and forme of doing it, be evill. And to this therefore we are to know, That the thing that the thing that is ≈øaid of done, is for the matter of it, good or evill; If good, yet it may be done ami≈ø≈øe in the manner. In 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 25, 2. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> that <hi>he did that which was right,</hi> (that is, that which was according to his will, and plea≈øed him well) <hi>but not with a perfect heart;</hi> though the thing he did, as al≈øo the greate≈øt part of that which <hi>Iehu</hi> did, was according to Gods command, and that which (for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it) God approved when done, yet they did it with an eye to them≈øelves only, out of ≈øelfe-love, and for their ≈øelfe intere≈øt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage only, and not of any love to God, or care, or de≈øire to plea≈øe or glorify him in it, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 10. 6, 7. But if the thing (for the matter of it) (be it opinion or practice) be evill, the doing or ≈øaying thereof from the heart, will not make it good, or better then it is. For if by this, the opinion or Action may be ju≈øtified, or ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excu≈øed, then mu≈øt the mo≈øt horrid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practi≈øes that ever were held or done by this, be ≈øo farre countenanced, ≈øuch as the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170417:24"/> opinions again≈øt Chri≈øts Divinity, and that to eat fle≈øh is as bad as to eate Soules, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the killing of the Saints of God, and the ≈øacrificing of mens children to Idolls, and the wor≈øhipping of the Hoa≈øt of Heaven. For all this tho≈øe that did maintaine and act them (at lea≈øt ≈øome of them) were per≈øwaded of the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of. And if no men of any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or per≈øwa≈øion among≈øt us, ≈øhall judge them≈øelves only to be the true Chri≈øtians, and all others Antichri≈øtians, and ≈øhall take up this per≈øwa≈øion, and perhaps from tho≈øe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>P≈øal:</hi> 137. 8, 9. That as they are able they may and mu≈øt de≈øtroy all the re≈øt. Or (being of a levelling judgement) that they may take away as they are able from others that have much to make an equality. May they therefore doe it? or is the thing ever the better becau≈øe they are per≈øwaded they may, nay (it may be) that they mu≈øt doe it? and is not the thing being ≈øinfull and again≈øt Gods law, ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ≈øtill notwith≈øtanding their per≈øwa≈øion. This poynt and ca≈øe of Con≈øcience is cleared and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to our hands by the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe in his own ca≈øe, who tells us in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. that he in what he did was a <hi>bla≈øpheamer, a per≈øecutor, and injurious, but that he obtained mercy,</hi> And we doe not find that the opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øes of tho≈øe Hereticks in <hi>Jude,</hi> and 2 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2. and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170417:25"/> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. are ≈øaid to be ever the le≈ø≈øe ≈øinfull or dangerous to ≈øome, becau≈øe they did probably believe them to be Truth. We grant it to be true, that it doth ≈øomewhat le≈ø≈øen the offence, becau≈øe it is of Ignorance in them that are mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yet we affirme that it is ≈øo much the greater again, as there is more of the will in it.</p>
            <p>5. But there is much of Hypocri≈øie al≈øo in the≈øe per≈øons in the≈øe ca≈øes. For they pretend to be indeed the only enlightned men and Saints, to have the ≈øpirit. That the truth is with them, and that their way is Gods way and the true and the right way. Whereas they are in truth but Hypocrites, Fal≈øe Teachers, Devills in the appearance of Angells of Light, under≈øtand not what they ≈øay, not having the Spirit, and going them≈øelves, and leading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with them to de≈øtruction, <hi>Jude.</hi> 2 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. <hi>Prov:</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>We ≈øhall in the next place lay down ≈øome particular in≈øtances of the Hypocri≈øie &amp; Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we are treating of, and wherein they doe each of them con≈øi≈øt.</p>

               <p>THere are ≈øome that make a new, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Hypocri≈øie, and ≈øay it is, where there is truth of Grace within, but yet, not ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace; Or would have the truth of Grace to con≈øi≈øt only in the degree, or mea≈øure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ≈øo admit Hypocrites to have the truth of grace in them.

That the Hypocrite him≈øelfe (be he here a member of a true vi≈øible Church, and never ≈øo glorious a profe≈ø≈øor) is in Gods account, and in truth, no Chri≈øtian, no more then the picture of a man is a man.

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> It may perhaps be farther objected, that the oyle which the fooli≈øh Virgins (that were Hypocrites) had, was the ≈øame kind of oyle which the wi≈øe Virgins had, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>

That it is true, that the text ≈øaith, that the fooli≈øh Virgins had oyle in their Lamps, but it cannot appeare by the text, to be of the ≈øame kind of oyle that the wi≈øe Virgins had. Nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be ≈øo, for the wi≈øe had their ≈øupply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, but the fooli≈øh theirs from without them. We grant the Hypocrite to have ≈øeeming Grace or gifts, but not of the ≈øame kind with the true Chri≈øtian, who≈øe oyle is of another kind, fed by the ≈øpirit of God within him, which ≈øpirit the Hypocrite hath not; His ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170417:44"/> grace, hath no rooting, as the feed of the ≈øtony and High way ground, and the building on the ≈øand. It hath not the cau≈øes of the true Graces, that are in the heart of the true Chri≈øtian, it is not ≈øo rooted and bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chri≈øt and his ≈øpirit, it works not ≈øo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to break and humble the heart for ≈øinne, and that out of a deep ≈øen≈øe of the love of God and Chri≈øt, ≈øo as to engage and fa≈øten in it a root and foundation of love towards God, and his people, for his ≈øake, that can never be razed out, but will be increa≈øing and growing ≈øtill, according to the promi≈øe of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. 17. <hi>And I will pray the Father, &amp; he ≈øhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> The Hypocrite is a tree that beareth fruit like as the true Chri≈øtian doth, but not a good tree, and therefore bringeth not forth good fruit, as the true Chri≈øtian doth; But the common grace of the Hypocrite, is a loo≈øe and ≈ølight piece of work in the ≈øoule, an opinion and fancy of Faith, Joy, and Peace, like to a building on the Sand, and to a rootle≈ø≈øe plant, ≈øtanding on his own bottome and loo≈øe, and not engrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tree. Without any true love to Chri≈øt, ≈øen≈øe of ≈øinne, change of the heart, or any ≈øuch like thing, and therefore will not ≈øtand under any ≈øtorme, will not abide any Temptation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may perhaps be farther objected, out of the Parable of the divers ≈øorts of hearers, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. That the ≈øame kind of grace that was in the bad hearers, was al≈øo in the good hearer, and differed only in degrees?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> To this we an≈øwer. That the ≈øcope of that Parable, is only to comfort, and ≈øatisfy the Di≈øciples, as touching the fewne≈ø≈øe of them that did receive the Go≈øpell, and profit by the Preaching thereof; And it was to lay open the various effects of the Preaching of the Go≈øpell, the meanes of begetting, and increa≈øe of the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace of Gods elect, and of the common grace of the Hypocrite, by the compari≈øon of the Sower, and his ≈øowing of ≈øeed corne in the ground. That the effect thereof is various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ground in which it is ca≈øt. That where the word falls into a ≈øtony heart, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 26. and a heart lo≈øt in the love of the world, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4, <hi>James</hi> 4 4. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 19. Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a wicked heart, there it is fruitle≈ø≈øe and lo≈øt. But where the word meets with a good and hone≈øt heart, which is a heart broken, and contrite for ≈øinne, and a heart that loveth God more then the world, of which there are few, there it doth bring forth more or le≈ø≈øe fruit. So that the ≈øeed ≈øowen in all the grounds, is the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170417:45"/> ≈øame, but the fruit not the ≈øame, for the bad ground, it is ≈øaid of the ≈øeed ≈øowen in it, that it had no root, and that it brought forth no fruit. So that although it be the ≈øame word that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks the common grace in the Hypocrite, and the ≈øpeciall grace in the Elect, yet that which is wrought thereby in one, is not the ≈øame that is wrought in another hearer thereof, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 16.</p>
               <p>And now by all this that hath been ≈øaid it may appeare, that Sincerity lyeth more in the quality and nature, then in the quantity and mea≈øure of the thing. But there will be ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more added, we hope, for the clearing of this poynt, by a better hand, in the la≈øt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this book.

               <p>We have done now with the explicatory, and ≈øhall come next to the Applicatory part of our di≈øcour≈øe. And out of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øaid, may we not now draw up this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion.

So that it is in the ≈øtate of the Kingdome of Chri≈øt, and where the Preaching of the Go≈øpell is, as where a man hath a corrupt ≈øtomack, and all the meats, the pure≈øt and the be≈øt he taketh in, do corrupt in it. And as the Sunne by his ≈øhining upon a ≈øtinking dunghill, draws forth the ≈ømell, and doth make the ≈øtink thereof to be the more, and the greater: So the foulene≈ø≈øe and corruption of ≈øome mens hearts is ≈øo great, and ≈øo much, that it corrupts all the pure truths of the word of God that comes in it; And the word gives occa≈øion to them, or rather they take occa≈øion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170417:58"/> by it, to ≈øhew forth their heart-corruption the more; And to them it is a ≈øavour of death unto death, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 16. And where the preaching of the Go≈øpell is, there is begotten in man occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øionally, and by accident, from the ≈øame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpell, and from the corruption of mans heart together, a Re≈øolution to become a Go≈øpell profe≈ø≈øor, that is like to a fal≈øe Conception, <hi>Phill. 1. 16. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 3. out of which at la≈øt there is bred and brought forth by a ≈øeeming act of Regeneration, a kind of changed or a new Creature, like to a fal≈øe Birth, one like to a Chri≈øtian, but one that is no Chri≈øtian indeed. And this being made up of ≈øuch corrupt matter, as the principles, foundation, and ends thereof, (which are altogether carnall.) It is ≈øaid to be a Birth of the fle≈øh, and the will of man, and not of God by his Spirit and word, as the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the true Chri≈øtian is. <hi>Mat. 16. 16, 17.

And this corrupt matter we ≈øpeak of, hath frequently a great influence upon men profe≈ø≈øing Religion in their actings in publick works, that whiles they act much, and goe very farre therein, they are carried forth in it by ≈øome of the≈øe ≈øini≈øter re≈øpects. So Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Churches and Commonwealths in their work of Ruling, and Preachers of the Go≈øpell in their work of Preaching, whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complaineth, <hi>Micah. 3: 11.

The Jewes had joy and gladne≈ø≈øe, a fea≈øt, and a good day, and many of the people of the land became Jewes;</hi> For the feare of them fell upon their enemies. So now the profe≈ø≈øion of the Go≈øpell of Chri≈øt is ≈øo much in reque≈øt, that the ≈øame is the high way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and favour. To be a zealous able Preacher of the Go≈øpell, or a carefull painfull Magi≈øtrate in the Common wealth, after the example of the greate≈øt men of the time, is a way to bring much furtherance to a mans ≈øelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends.

In the heart of the true Chri≈øtian, as the heart it ≈øelf is rooted in Chri≈øt, So is grace by Chri≈øts Spirit rooted in the heart, &amp; ≈øprings from the ≈øpirituall life that is within it, which is Chri≈øt who dwelleth in it, <hi>Ephe≈ø. 3. 17. That Chri≈øt may dwell in your hearts by Faith. Coll. 2. 7. Rooted and built up in him. &amp;c. Rom. 6. 5. For if wee

               <p>2. True grace in the heart of a true Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, doth flow naturally from it, as the water out of a ≈øpring, that will ≈øtill i≈ø≈øue forth, and as the operations of life move in a living body, which cannot be ≈øtopt while the body is alive, <hi>Acts 19. 20. We cannot but ≈øpeak the things we have ≈øeen and heard, Io. 7. 38. Out of his belly ≈øhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water, this he ≈øpoke of the ≈øpirit, which they that believe on him ≈øhould receive &amp;c. 1 Io 3. 3. Acts 15. 9.

P≈øal.</hi> 119. 174. and 40. 8. and 39. 3. <hi>Pro. 10. 11. 1 Pe. 2. 2</hi> But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations of that ≈øeeming grace which is in the heart of an Hypocrite are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and come heavily, as water drawne up by a Pumpe, bucket, or ≈øuch like engine, and as the motions of ≈øeeming life, in a dead body, made by art, after the fa≈øhion of men and bea≈øts, which have been made to act, and doe like to living bea≈øts and men. He is as a Ci≈øterne that hath no water any longer then it is powred in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. Yet hath he not root in him≈øelf, but dureth for a while.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:170417:67"/>
               <p>3. The true grace in the heart of a true Chri≈øtian, is for the mo≈øt part quick, lively, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and vigorous, as the ≈øpring water is, and the motions of life in the living part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are, the more it doth, the more it may move and act, <hi>Heb. 6. 10. Your labour of love, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by Faith, 1 Io. 3. 3. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifyeth him≈øelfe &amp;c. Jo. 7. 38, 39. 1 Pe. 1. 3. <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nto a lively hope &amp;c.</hi> But the common work of the ≈øpirit in the Hypocrite is not ≈øo, but dull, dead, and ineffectuall. <hi>Iames 2. 20. Faith without works is dead.</hi> He is not ≈øo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive within in his heart towards God, as he is without in his tongue, but his heart acts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, for this doth naturally in him work wickednes, <hi>P≈ø. 58. 2. Ezek. 33. 33. With their mouth they ≈øhew much love, but their heart goeth after their coveteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi> And he doth no more in his heart, towards the things that are good, then an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall leg or tooth, to the motions of life in the body, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>4. True grace out of the heart of a true Chri≈øtian, doth commonly flow out abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the water out of a lively Spring, <hi>Jo. 7. 38, 39. Out of his belly ≈øhall flow Rivers, &amp;c.</hi> But that which is within the heart of an Hypocrite is but little, and of another kind; That therefore that the Hypocrite receiveth herein, is compared to a Ta≈øt, that which is as by a Gargari≈øme in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170417:67"/> the mouth received in; but that the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian receiveth to eating and drinking, or to the vertue and ≈øtrength he gets: by ≈øtrong a Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which remaineth, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>5. The true grace in the heart of the true Chri≈øtian is fixed, con≈øtant and certaine as the Root of a tree, and doth e≈øtabli≈øh him that hath it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 9. But that which appeares in an Hypocrite, is fleeting, tran≈øient, and incertaine, like to a thin vapour or Cloud, <hi>Jade</hi> v: 12. <hi>Clouds they are without water, carried about with wind, Ho≈øea 6. 4. Your goodne≈ø≈øe is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The true grace in the true Chri≈øtian, is commonly increa≈øing &amp; growing as the young tree, or child, <hi>P≈øal. 84. 7. They goe from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength. 2 The≈ø≈ø. 1. 3: Your faith groweth exceedingly. P≈øal.</hi> 1. 2. But otherwi≈øe it is in that which is in the Hypocrite, becau≈øe it lacketh root, it doth not grow but wither away, <hi>Ma. 13. 6, 21. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they had no root they withered away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The true grace albeit it doth grow, yet it doth commonly grow lea≈øurely and by degrees, <hi>Heb 5. 12. Jer: 14, 9. Luke 24. 25.</hi> But that which is in the Hypocrite, is ≈øoon up, and groweth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fa≈øt, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. 20, 21. And in him the proverb is fulfilled, Soon ripe ≈øoon rotten.</p>
               <p>8. True Grace in the true Chri≈øtian, as it is pure in it ≈øelfe, ≈øo is it of a purifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170417:68"/> nature, it worketh out ≈øinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the heart. As the Spring the dirt that is within it, <hi>Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by faith, 1 Pe. 1. 22. Seeing ye have purified your ≈øoules, &amp;c 1 Io. 3. 3. Io</hi> 7. 38, 39. But otherwi≈øe it is in the heart of the Hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>9. The true Grace in the heart of the true Chri≈øtian is very powerfull, prevalent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, as a lively Spring, or flood of water, that doth carry all before it, it will make its way through all difficulties, till it hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned its end 1 <hi>Io. 5. 4. What≈øoever is borne of God overcometh the World. Ro. 8. 35, 38, 39. What ≈øhall ≈øeparate us &amp;c Ephe. 1. 19.

We are more then conquerors &amp;c. 1 Cor. 4 20. The kingdome of God is not in word but in power, 1 The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 1. 5. But the common work of the Spirit in the heart of an Hypocrite, hath no ≈øuch power or prevalency in it, but it may be ea≈øily interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abated by temptation or oppo≈øition. <hi>Mat. 13. 6, 21. Job:</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>12. And la≈øtly true Grace out of the heart of the true Chri≈øtian, doth i≈ø≈øue continually without end, as a lively Spring that is ≈øeldome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170417:68"/> or never dry, <hi>Io: 7. 38, 39. P≈øal:</hi> 1. 3.

                  <p>The difference between the true Christian and the Hypocrite in their Out≈øide.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>For the fir≈øt. The difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true and counterfeit Chri≈øtian, in their out≈øide, or by their externall works: we are to know, that the Hypocrite (As we have ≈øaid) may have as faire an Out≈øide, as the be≈øt Chri≈øtian in the World; And ≈øome Hypocrites are ≈øuch, and continue ≈øo to their dying day; and can ≈øay with that young man, <hi>Mat. 19 17, 18, 19. All the≈øe things have I kept from my youth up.</hi> And yet in mo≈øt of them perhaps, if they be narrowly watched, ≈øome halting may be found in this al≈øo, as to their conver≈øation. The true Chri≈øtian is altogether a Chri≈øtian, doth follow Chri≈øt fully in all things, and whether ≈øoever
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170417:69"/> he goes, and allwaies. And he being wrought upon ≈øo effectually by the word and ≈øpirit, as to be ca≈øt into the mould, or transformed into the likene≈ø≈øe thereof: he is for a pre≈øent compliance with the whole will of God in all things, he doth walke in all the commandments of God blamele≈ø≈øe; He e≈øcheweth all that is evill, and doth all that is good, <hi>Ephe≈ø: 4. 28. Zach. 13. 4, 5 I≈øa.</hi> 1. 16, 17. He is for all duties to God, and duties to man, he is for piety, ju≈øtice, and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. And he is for Godline≈ø≈øe not only in the forme, but in the power thereof; he is for greater, for le≈ø≈øer, for publick for private duties; he is for duties that are in e≈øteeme, and duties out of e≈øteeme, he is for more and for le≈ø≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable duties and performances; for duties of mercy and charity, as well as for duties that have outward profits and advantages attending them, and in them all he is alike con≈øtant and indu≈øtrious in their proper places. And as to all the will of God, and duty and work thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on man, he is univer≈øall and uniforme among≈øt all per≈øons, in all times, places, and ca≈øes, one and the ≈øame, and changeth not, but continueth ≈øo to his dying day, <hi>P≈øal: 18. 21, 23, 24. For I have kept the waies of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. I was al≈øo upright before him. And I kept my ≈øelfe from mine iniquity, Luke</hi> 1. 6. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, they

Mat:</hi> 8. 10. and 16. 24. <hi>Jo. 4. 24. 1 Sam. 12. 3, 4. 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 2. But the Hypocrite is but almo≈øt, or halfe a Chri≈øtian, doth but ≈øome things and follow Chri≈øt in part. And he (as to this) is commonly faulty in one of the≈øe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. 1. Either he will put off, and delay to doe what he is commanded. <hi>Luke 9 59. Suffer me fir≈øt to goe and bury my Father, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Or he will doe it but by halves when he doth it, <hi>Ho≈øea 7. 8, 16. Numb.</hi> 32. 11. 3. Or he will doe too much, more then is given him in command by God, being led therein by his own fancy, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, or ≈øome humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ≈øo it is a Will wor≈øhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 6. &amp;c. <hi>Why do thy Di≈øeiples tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe the Traditions of the Elders &amp;c.

Or he is all for the duties of the fir≈øt table, he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God religious, but towards man unju≈øt, cruell, unfaithfull, &amp;c. <hi>E≈øay 1. 11, 12, 13.

                  <p>The true Chri≈øtian hath, and mu≈øt have the knowledge of God, for without this, the heart cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. And ≈øo the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may have, and hath al≈øo. But there are the≈øe differences between the knowledge of the one, and the knowledge of the other. 1. The knowledge of the true Chri≈øtian is commonly a more clerae, and di≈øtinct knowledge, <hi>Phill. 1. 9, 10. Mat:</hi> 13. 11. But that of the Hypocrite a more generall, confu≈øed, and ob≈øcure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and ≈øuch was the knowledge of the Scribes and Phari≈øees of the Scripture. 2. That of the true Chri≈øtian is more certain, as being grounded upon the Scripture, and al≈øo upon ≈øome practi≈øe, and experience of the things known. And it is like to the knowledge that a man hath of meats, drinks, and medicines, by the view, ta≈øt, and trial over and be≈øides his reading of them.

Heb: 5. 14. P≈øal: 34. 8. 1 Pet:</hi> 2. 3. But that of the Hypocrite is only ≈øpeculative and

               <p>The true Chri≈øtian doth, and mu≈øt reform his life. And the Hypocrite ≈øeemeth to doe ≈øo; for the evill ≈øpirit ≈øeems to be ca≈øt out of him al≈øo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 45. But there is a great deal of odds in the frame and di≈øpo≈øition of their hearts therein, both in the fir≈øt undertaking, and in their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acting, and that in the leaving or omi≈ø≈øion of evil, and in the doing of good, and their motives and ends therein: The true Chri≈øtian in his fir≈øt undertaking of the profe≈ø≈øion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doth de≈øign and aim at an univer≈øal and compleat obedience &amp; conformity to the whole will of God, to keep all his Commandments, <hi>P≈ø. 101. 1, 2 3, &amp;c. 119. 6. When I have re≈øpect to all thy Commandements.</hi> Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We trust we have a good con≈øcience in all things, willing to live hone≈øtly.</hi> Acts 24. 16. But the de≈øign of the Hypocrite is to go ≈øo far and doe ≈øo much therein as may ≈øerve to his own end, which is not to plea≈øe and glorifie God, but to plea≈øe and advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. And hence it is that it doth ≈øometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170417:94"/> to doe the good he ought to do, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbear to do the evil he ought not to do, ≈øometimes doe the good he ought to doe, <hi>Mat. 14. 5. Mark 12. 12. Luke</hi> 20. 19. and 22. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22. And in his further acting in what he doth, and in what he forbeareth to doe. All that the Hypocrite doth think of in the forbearance of, or flying from evil, is to forbear it for his own end therein. But the true Chri≈øtian therein is moved from the fear of God, <hi>Gen. 39. 9. Prov.</hi> 14. 1. and the hatred of ≈øin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 4. And all that he doth think of in doing of good, is the work to be done, as in Praier, only to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the true Chri≈øtian is carefull of the manner and order of his doing, of the di≈øpo≈øition of his heart, and his aim and ends therein. That in it he be carried out from the con≈øcience of the command of God, and his obedience thereunto; his love to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 14. That hee be ≈øwayed more therein by the fear of God than the fear of men, and with de≈øire to plea≈øe God rather than to plea≈øe men, and that he take more care to fulfill the will of God than of men, Gal. 1. 10 <hi>Nor do I ≈øeek to plea≈øe men,</hi> &amp;c. P≈øal. 119. 24. That what he doth be done by the rule of Gods Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 20, 21. That he doe it with his whole heart, willingly and cheerfully, <hi>P≈øal. 110. 3. Thy people ≈øhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample with this acknowledgement of ≈øin, there
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170417:94"/> is joyned a heart broken for ≈øin, hating it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolving again≈øt it, and faith in the blood of Chri≈øt, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 10. P≈øal. 51. 4. Luke 18. 10. Dan. 7. 7, 8, 9. Ezra 10. 2. Mark</hi> 1. 15. And he hath an end beyond him≈øelf, and the ≈øaving of his ≈øoul. To plea≈øe God, to doe it to the Lord, for Gods ≈øake, as well for his own ≈øake, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and glory of the name of God and Chri≈øt, as well as for the good of his own ≈øoul, Phil. 1. 21. <hi>For me to live is Chri≈øt</hi> (that is) Chri≈øt is both the author and end of my life: I live for him, I live in him, I live by him, I live to him, or all the gain that I aim at in life or death is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, Acts 20. 24. and 21. 13. <hi>I am ready to dye for the name of the Lord Ie≈øus,</hi> Mat. 6. 9, 13. <hi>Rom. 9. 3. Lam.</hi> 2. 18. But otherwi≈øe it is in the heart of the Hypocrite in all that hee doth of good, and forbeareth to do of evil. It is for his own end. He leaves his ≈øin, but loves it ≈øtil. He hath not left it for love of God, po≈ø≈øibly he may leave it for ≈øome fear of God and his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or fear of men, as Magi≈øtrates, Mini≈øters, Parents, and the like, and fear of ≈øome harme that may come to him by them; for he hath a ≈ølavi≈øh fear, <hi>Gen. 28. 8. Mat.</hi> 14. 5. but bee is the ≈øame man, and hath the ≈øame mind ≈øtill as he had, <hi>Prov. 1. 22, 28, 29. He loveth ≈øimplicitie.</hi> &amp;c. So he may confe≈øs ≈øin without any heart broken for or broken from ≈øin, without any hatred of ≈øin,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170417:95"/> or purpo≈øe to leave it, or faith in Chri≈øt at all, as <hi>Iudas, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam. 15 24, 25. Mat. 27. 2, 3 Gen.</hi> 4. 4, &amp;c. <hi>Deut. 1, 41. Prov.</hi> 28. 13. And he leaveth evill and doth good from the love to him≈øelf, and for his ≈øelf-≈øatisfaction, and that he may doe him≈øelf good thereby, either for his own ea≈øe, or for his own glory and applau≈øe, or ≈øome other advantage that hee hath, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to have thereby to accrew to him≈øelf; for he is mercenary, John 6. 26. <hi>Ye ≈øeek me not becau≈øe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but becau≈øe ye eat of the loaves, and were filled.</hi> He may make again by godline≈øs; and ≈øo for ≈øelf. ends, and out of ≈øelf love doth ≈øeek him≈øelfe, and ≈øerve his own ends altogether whiles he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to ≈øeek God, out of love to him, and to ≈øerve the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Rom. 16. 18. <hi>Serve not our Lord but their own belly</hi> Phil. 3, 19. <hi>who≈øe God is their belly,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4, 5. <hi>Lovers of their own ≈øelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lovers of plea≈øure more than lovers of God: Having a form of Godline≈øs,</hi> &amp;c.

And ≈øo he may forbear to doe the evil that otherwi≈øe he would doe, and doe the good that otherwi≈øe he would not do. So the Scribes and Phari≈øees did fa≈øt and pray to get prai≈øe and wealth, <hi>Mat. 6 2. 16. Mat. 23, 14, 15. Zach. 7. 5. Did ye fa≈øt unto me,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170417:95"/> even to me, &amp;c.</hi> Ho≈øea 7. 14, 15. <hi>And they have not cried unto me with their heart; they a≈ø≈øemble them≈øelves for corn and wine,</hi> &amp;c. and 10. 1. <hi>He bringeth forth fruir to him≈øelf.</hi> Sometimes the fear of man keeps him from the doing of evil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 5. and 21. 46. Sometimes this al≈øo may provoke him to ≈øome good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 8. And as there is a great deal of difference in their minds as to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ≈øo there is as to their ≈øufferings al≈øo for Chri≈øt. The true Chri≈øtian mu≈øt ≈øuffer for Chri≈øt, and mu≈øt be ready, and will be able to leave all for him. The Hyocrite al≈øo may, and ≈øomtimes doth ≈øuffer many things for Chri≈øt. But the one of them hath fir≈øt learned to deny him≈øelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he take up his cro≈øs; the other takes up his cro≈øs before that he hath learned to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. The one doth ≈øuffer out of love to Chri≈øt for Righteou≈øne≈øs and the Go≈øpels ≈øake, for the glory of Chri≈øt, and advantage of Chri≈øtians; The other out of a ≈øelf-love, for his own ≈øake, as for his own glory and prai≈øe, or for ≈øome earthly advantage to him≈øelf. So <hi>Judas</hi> ≈øuffered with the re≈øt for Chri≈øt, to fill his pur≈øe, and to be great in Chri≈øts kingdom, which hee thought would be an earthly kingdom, 1 Cor. 13. 3. <hi>And though I give my body to be burned, and have not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> P≈øal. 44. 22. 2 Tim. 2 10.

There is in him fle≈øh and ≈øpirit, a regenerate and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, Rom. 7. 18, 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God in the inward man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that which I do I allow not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the evil I have that doe I,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. P≈øal. 32. 2. Nor doth the true Chri≈øtian, or he is not ready to commit all ≈øorts of ≈øin, and at all times and alwaies as the Hypocrite is, who maketh it his trade to ≈øin. P≈øal. 50. 19. <hi>Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit, thou ≈øitte≈øt and ≈øpeake≈øt,</hi> &amp;c. And therfore he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be as skilful in it as he can, Jer. 9. 5. <hi>They have taught their tongues to ≈øpeak lyes.</hi> And he giveth up him≈øelf wholly to it, and to act all kinde of ≈øin, as a man of a trade doth give him≈øelfe up to his trade, to doe all that belongs to it, and to doe it alwaies. Now he that is born of God cannot thus ≈øin. Joh. 3. 9. It is not his ordinary practi≈øe ≈øo to ≈øin; but if happily he fall into a ≈øin, he doth not often; his ≈øin is occa≈øional, like to the true mans going out of the highway, who comes in again pre≈øently, and like a river that is turned out of its channel by ≈øome ≈øtop or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, which will get in again as ≈øoon as it can. He doth not go in the way of Gods commandments
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170417:99"/> as the Hypocrite doth; for hee like as the thiefe comes in the true mans way, for the pre≈øent to ≈øerve his turn, and to doe mi≈øchief onely; el≈øe he keeps by-waies and ob≈øcure places. Nor doth the true Chri≈øtian give and yeeld up him≈øelf to the ≈øervice of ≈øinne, as a ≈øervant to his ma≈øters work, Rom. 6. 16. but as a pri≈øoner is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it again≈øt his will, he yeeldeth him≈øelf for the pre≈øent, as being unable to prevent it, Rom. 7. 23, 24. <hi>But I ≈øee another law in my members, bringing me into eaptivitie,</hi> &amp;c. Nor doth the true Chri≈øtian, or can he fall totally and finally, <hi>Mat. 24. 24. deceive if po≈ø≈øibly the very elect,</hi> as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may doe, and oftentimes doth. The true Chri≈øtian is like to the good tree, that doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily bring forth good fruit, which yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily may by ≈øome accidents faile ≈øome years; or he is as a man of healthy con≈øtitution that fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth once, or more than once into a fit of ≈øicknes, but otherwi≈øe is healthy alwaies. But the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite he is iike to one that hath one of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, his liver or his lungs corrupted and rotten, he is alwaias, and all over ≈øick. And ≈øin in the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is in ≈øome of the≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects fitly compared by ≈øome to the dirt in a lively pure ≈øpring, that will not ≈øuffer it to bee quiet, bvt will be working it out. But it is in the Hypocrite as in the ≈øtanding pool that gathereth the mud, and keeps in when it hath it; or as it

He is therfore di≈øplea≈øed with him≈øelfe, and grieved for it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of it, is afraid of Gods di≈øplea≈øure by it, as a child of the di≈øplea≈øure of a father when he hath done a fault; and therefore he is glad of any help herein for his cure: For the ≈øin of the true Chri≈øtian to him, is as the cruel ≈øervice of the I≈øraelites under their cruell Taskma≈øters in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was to them. Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me,</hi> &amp;c. Or as a man that being fallen into the fire, and like to bee burnt, is ≈ønatcht out of the ≈øame, and ≈øo e≈øca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the danger; ≈øo the true Chri≈øtian he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confe≈øs, and willing to for≈øake his ≈øin, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13.

               </argument>
               <p>The ≈øincerre Chri≈øtian, as he is a new creature, ≈øo he is to yeeld and perform a new obedience to God in Chri≈øt, in his doing and ≈øuffering of the will of God, according to the Go≈øpel, <hi>Rom. 16. 19. 26. 1 Pet. 1. 22.

But there is a va≈øt difference between them herein al≈øo. 1 In the per≈øon doing. 2 In the thing done. 1 In the per≈øon doing. The ≈øincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian looks to it, that he him≈øelf be rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the work, that he him≈øelf be good and accepted of God, that he be in Chri≈øt by faith, &amp; ≈øo a new creature, otherwi≈øe his works cannot be accepted. <hi>Deut. 33. 10, 11. Gen. 4. 4, 5. God had re≈øpect to Abel and his offering,</hi> &amp;c. But the hypocrite hath no regard of this, but being ≈øtil in his ≈øins, &amp; without the wedding garment of Chri≈øts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs upon him, his work is not accepted, <hi>God heareth not ≈øinners,</hi> Joh 9. 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 11, 12. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 9. 2 In the thing done.

But the the obedience of the Hypocrite floweth from corrupt principles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:170417:103"/>
               <p>2 The new obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is regular and orderly.

But the obedience of the Hypocrite is oft times a blind and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obedience not grounded upon, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Word of God, but upon his own, or ≈øome other mans fancy and opinion. Rom. 10. 1, 2. <hi>They have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 He doth it knowingly and beleevingly; he not onely hath a word for what he beleeveth, and doth, but he knoweth he hath ≈øuch a word for it, and ≈øo doth it in faith, which the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite heedeth little, and therefore is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Heb. 11. 4, 6. Acts 17. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The new obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is an exact and compleat obedience; 1 it is univer≈øal. He is holy in all manner of conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yeelds him≈øelf to do and ≈øuffer all that God will have him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. But that of the Hypocrite is lame and defective. And the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian it is univer≈øal.</p>

To other men, to good men, to bad men, to friends, to enemies, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to ≈øtrangers. In relation, as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, Mini≈øter, People, Husband, Wife, Parent, Child, Ma≈øter, Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Duties of Word, of Work, greater, le≈ø≈øer, publick, private; of more and le≈øs advantage, as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. 2. <hi>who was a devout man, one that gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alwayes.</hi> Luke 1 6. And he doth al≈øo ≈øuffer all that God ≈øhall call him to ≈øuffer. Acts 21. 12. 13. And all this for the leaving of evil, and the doing of good. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian doth his duty, 1 In all places. The Hypocrite he is not ≈øo carefull and exact in ≈øome, as he is in other places, at home and in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170417:105"/> private, as he is abroad and in publick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5. The Phari≈øees were in appearance very devout, and did much in the Sinagogues, and in the ≈øtreets, but did nothing at all in their clo≈øets. But the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian having his eye upon God, who is in all places alike, is alike carefull and exact in all places, in private as in publick, at home as abroad, in his clo≈øet as in his hou≈øe, ≈øecretly as openly. So <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 9, 10. when tempted by his wanton Mi≈øtris to commit ≈øecret wickedne≈øs with her, an≈øwereth her, <hi>How can I doe this great wickedne≈øs and ≈øin again≈øt God?</hi> P≈øalm 101. 2. <hi>I will walk within my hou≈øe with a perfect heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 In all times, ca≈øes and conditions. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, he is good at ≈øome times, and in ≈øome ca≈øes, as in times of peace and pro≈øperitie, and times wherein he may gain, and not lo≈øe by his goodne≈øs, or whiles he is a wed by the pre≈øence of good men, Parents, Magi≈øtrates, or Mini≈øtees, and the like, and no longer. And ≈øo it ≈øeems it was with <hi>Joa≈øh,</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 2. <hi>Who did tho<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which was right in the ≈øight of the Lord all the daies of Jehoiadah the Prie≈øt.</hi> And ≈øuch are tho≈øe ≈øervants, Ephe≈ø 6. 6. <hi>That ≈øerve their masters with eye ≈øervice as men plea≈øers,</hi> &amp;c. Job 27. 10. <hi>Will he alwaies call upon God?</hi> But the true Chri≈øtian is alike good and carefull in all times, ca≈øes, changes, and conditions, in time of health as time of ≈øicknes,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170417:105"/> in time of peace as in time of trouble, <hi>Phil. 4. 11. I have learned in what≈øoever e≈øtate I am therewith to be content.</hi> Job 1. 8. 12, 21, 22. And he is the ≈øame in the pre≈øence of God onely, and when no other eye is upon him, <hi>Phil. 2. 12. As ye have alwaies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not in my pre≈øence onely, but much more in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence,</hi> &amp;c. Ephe≈ø. 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Servants be obedient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in ≈øinglene≈øs of heart as unto Chri≈øt,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 3. 22. And he is the ≈øame in time of the per≈øecuted, as he is in the time of the flouring ≈øtate of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel. He can (if need be) leave all for Chri≈øt, and the Go≈øpels ≈øake, 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5. <hi>But in all things approving our ≈øelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in afflictions,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. We had the ≈øentence of death in our ≈øelves,</hi> &amp;c. v. 12. <hi>in ≈øimplicitie and godly ≈øinceritie, wee have had our conver≈øation,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 10. 28. <hi>We have left all and followed thee.</hi> Acts 21. 12, 13. <hi>I am ready not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be bound, but al≈øo to dye at Jeru≈øalem for the Name of the Lord Ie≈øus,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 26, 27. P≈øalm 119. 157, 161.</p>
               <p>3 In all company. The Hypocrite he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly better in ≈øome, than he is in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 2. But the true Chri≈øtian he is alike in all company, in the company of good, of bad men, of friends, of enemies, P≈øalm 119. 46. <hi>I will ≈øpeak of thy te≈øtimonies before Kings,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>as ye have obeyed not onely in my pre≈øence, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The true Chri≈øtian holds out to the end: The Hypocrite, he is at the be≈øt, <hi>un≈øtable in all his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170417:106"/> waies,</hi> James 1. 8. <hi>as a cloud without water carried by the wind.</hi> Iude v. 12. apt to ≈øtart a≈øide like <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful bow.</hi> Ho≈øea 7. 16. He is very like to ≈øtart a≈øide in times of trial. Iob 27. 10. <hi>Will he alwaies call upon God?</hi> And he doth very often fall clean away to prophane≈øs in life, here≈øie, and opinion, or to both. 1 Iohn 2. 19. <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us.</hi> 2 Pet. 2 22. <hi>It is happened to them according to the Proverb, The Dog is turned to the vomit again. and the low that was wa≈øhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Sam. 13. 8. and 28. 7. Mat. 13. 21, 22. But this the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian connot doe <hi>Mat. 24. 14. <hi>They ≈øhall deceive if it were po≈ø≈øible the very elect.</hi> For this new obedience of his is both a growing and increa≈øing obedience Rev. 2. 19. <hi>His la≈øt works are better than his fir≈øt.</hi> And it is a la≈øting, per≈øevering, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obedience. P≈øal. 119. 112. <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy ≈øtatutes, alwaies even to the end,</hi> v. 24. <hi>continnally for ever and ever,</hi> Luke 2. 37. Yea and he doth commonly grow better &amp; better, <hi>Ephe≈ø. 2. 21. 2 The≈ø.</hi> 1. 3. But the Hypocrite hee doth commonly grow wor≈øe and wor≈øe, 2 Tim. 3. 13. <hi>But Seducers wox wor≈øe and wor≈øe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being deceived,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 20. This new obedience therefore of the new creature is ≈øuch, as it breaks through, and gets over all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, Acts 2. 42. <hi>Such as the≈øe</hi> (i.) mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and threats.</hi> Acts 4. 19. <hi>Whether it be right in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170417:106"/> the ≈øight of God to hearken to you more than unto God judge ye?</hi> and 5. 29. <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men,</hi> Dan. 3. 12. 16.</p>
               <p>2 Mens examples of all ≈øorts. <hi>Io≈øh. 24. 15. Choo≈øe you this day whom you will ≈øerve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But as for me and my hou≈øe we will ≈øerve the Lord.</hi> Gen. 6. 9. and 7. 1.</p>
               <p>3 Worldly profits and advantages, ≈øuch as honour, plea≈øure, riches, and the like. Heb. 11. 8. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was called to goe out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>went,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> v. 24, 25. <hi>when he came to years he refu≈øed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>choo≈øing rather,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4 Carnal rea≈øonings. <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By faith Noah being warned of God in a dream,</hi> Gal. 1. 16, 17. I <hi>conferred not with fle≈øh and blood.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5 Relations and natural affections dependant upon them. Heb. 11. 17. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up, &amp;c. his ≈øonne, his only ≈øonne,</hi> Deut. 33. 9.</p>
               <p>But 2. the obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is compleat and entire al≈øo as to him that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for it is the obedience of his whole man bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ≈øoul. The obedience of the Hypocrite is commonly counterfeit, and not from his heart; ≈øometimes with a part of his heart only, and never with his whole heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. There is action without affection, the lips are without the heart in it. It cometh coldly from him, without any vigour or life of the inner
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170417:107"/> man, Ezech. 33. 31. <hi>their heart goeth after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetou≈øne≈øs,</hi> I≈øa. 29. 13. <hi>This people draw nigh to mee with their mouth but their heart is far from me,</hi> P≈ø. 78. 34, 35, 36. <hi>They returned and enquired early after God, neverthele≈øs they did flatter him with their mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for their heart was not right with him,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 3. 10. <hi>And yet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>her treacherous Si≈øter Judah hath not turned unto me with hgr whole heart but feignedly,</hi> &amp;c. Amos 8. 5, 6. Ho≈øea 7. 14. But the new obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is a cordial and affectionate obedience of the whole inward and outward man both together. That which he beleeveth, and that which he doth, or leaveth undone, it is all frrom his very heart. Rom. 6. 17. <hi>You have obeyed from the heart the Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. And it is with the whole heart, <hi>P≈ø. 119. 10, 145 With my whole heart have I ≈øought thee,</hi> &amp;c. So that what he doth he doth with his whole ≈øoul, mind, con≈øcience, wil, &amp; affections all concurring with him therein. He doth with all his might and ≈øtrength de≈øire, and endeavour to doe the whole will of God, P≈øal. 119. 10. 34. 69. <hi>I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart,</hi> Acts 8. 37. <hi>If thou believe≈øt with al thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. His grace within, and his work without is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, 2 Tim. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 6. 6. 1 Sam. 12. 20. Ezek. 11. 19, 20. Rom. 12. 8.</p>
               <p>5 As he is careful to doe all God requireth, and with the whole man, ≈øo is he careful to doe no more than God requireth. But the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170417:107"/> hath additions of his own and other mens inventions, <hi>Jer</hi> 32. 35. P≈ø. 106. 39. Mat. 15. 2, 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6 The new obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is a real obedience. 1 That of the Hypocrite is onely verbal and complemental, Mat. 21. 28, 29, 30. A certain man had two ≈øons, and he ≈øaid to one of them, Goe and work to day in my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; And he ≈øaid, I go ≈øir, but went not. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 45. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the thing which I ≈øay? But the obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is an obedience that is in deeds as well as in words, <hi>Rom. 15. 18. Col.</hi> 3. 17. 2 That of the Hypocrite is feigned and counterfeit, as we have ≈øhewed, P≈ø. 78. 36. But this of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is as he him≈øelf is indeed what he ≈øeemeth.</p>
               <p>7 This new obedience of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian as it is exact and compleat for the matter ≈øo for the manner of it, and the mind of the doer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Hypocrite he onely mindeth the worke done, and not how it bee done, or with what minde hee doth it. But the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is careful not only what he doth, but how &amp; with what mind he doth it. And for this he doth and ≈øuffereth it (i.) in Chri≈øts name, where the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth dare adventure to goe to God in his own name, and upon his own account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 13 &amp;c.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170417:108"/> 
                  <hi>He ≈øaw there a man that had not on a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 18. 11 <hi>the Phari≈øee praied, and ≈øaid, God I thank thee, I am not,</hi> &amp;c. Iohn 6. 64. and 7. 5. or otherwi≈øe ask doubtingly, Iames 1. 7, 8. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian he dares not come to God but with Ie≈øus Chri≈øt in his heart and mouth; and ≈øo coming, he beleeves that he ≈øhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted both in his per≈øon and ≈øervice. Hee doth ask in faith: his Prayer is the prayer of Faith, Iames 5. 15, 16. 1 Tim. 2. 8. Iames 1. 6. Heb. 11. 4, 6. <hi>By Faith Abel offered to God a more excellent ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice than Cain, &amp;c. But without Faith it is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to plea≈øe him; for he that cometh to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> Iohn 16, 23, 24. &amp; 14 6.</p>
               <p>2 He doth, and ≈øuffereth preparedly: where the Hypocrites heart in his coming to God in ≈øervice is altogether unprepared for it, as being voyd of the love and fear, and reverence of God in it, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 12. 14, and 20 23. P≈øal. 78. 34, 35, 36. I≈øa. 29. 13. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian his heart is ready and prepared to and for his obedience in doing or ≈øuffering as an in≈øtrument when ≈øet in tune is ready to be plaid upon. He loves and fears God; hee hath high, holy, and reverend thoughts of Gods name, wayes, and wor≈øhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Chron. 30 9. P≈øalm 108. 1. P≈øal. 57. 7 Rom. 1, 15 Mal 1. 6, 7, 8, 17. Deut. 10. 12. Acts 21. 13.</p>
               <p>3 He doth it ≈øincerely, where the Hypocrite doth it with a double and deceitful heart all
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170417:108"/> that he doth, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 78. 34, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 4. 8. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian he doth it with a true &amp; plaine heart, <hi>Heb. 10 22. Rom. 12. 8, 9. 1 Pet.</hi> 1 2. So the Magi≈øtrate ruling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. The Mini≈øter in preaching, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. 1 The≈ø</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. but to this we have ≈øpoken before.</p>
               <p>4 He doth it cheerfully and joyfully. Where the Hypocrite is in his obedience (e≈øpecially in the ≈øervice of God) unwilling to, and unchear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it, and takes little or no delight, but is ≈øoon weary of, and tyred in it, <hi>Amos 8. 5. When will the new Moon be gone?</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 1. 15. <hi>Behold what a wearine≈øs it is.</hi> Job 27. 10. The true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian he delights in it, it is his meate and drink; the yoak herein upon him is an ea≈øie yoake to him, <hi>P≈øal. 40 8. Mat 11. 30. P≈øal. 119 47. I ≈øhall delight my ≈øelf in thy Commandments,</hi> 2 Cor, 8. 19. 1 <hi>Pet 5. 2. 2 Cor 9 7. I≈øa. 58. 13. If thou call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> 1 Cor. 29 9.

               <p>5 He doth it patiently. Where the Hypocrite is commonly in that which he doth and ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth impatient and complaining again≈øt God, Mal. 3. 14, 15. <hi>Ye ≈øay it is in vain to ≈øerve the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Kings 6. 33. <hi>This evil is from the Lord, what ≈øhould I wait,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170417:109"/> 25. 23, 24. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian hee is patient, and doth quietly ≈øubmit to the will of God therein, 1 Sam. 3. 17, 18. <hi>It is the Lord let him do what ≈øeemeth him good.</hi> 2 Kings 20. 19, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord.</hi> Job 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 He doth it diligently, where the Hypocrite is commonly in his obedience e≈øpecially in Gods ≈øervice carele≈øs and negligent, Mal. 1. 14. <hi>Which hath in his flock a male, and ≈øacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 25. 24. He that had but one talent. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is u≈øuually ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent and exact herein, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 12. I will not be negligent,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 8. 22. 1 Tim. 4. 14.</p>
               <p>7 Hee doth it humbly, where the Hypocrite doth his work proudly, and conceitedly, as the Phari≈øee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. The ≈øincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian doth it with the ≈øen≈øe of his ≈øinne, and with a broken and contrite heart. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13.</p>
               <p>8 He doth it fervently, where the Hypocrite is cold and perfunctory in his ≈øervice. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is fervent in ≈øpirit, and doth what hee doth fervently, <hi>Coll.</hi> 4. 12. James 5 16. Rom. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>9 He doth it lovingly, where the Hypocrite doth it often with corrupt affections. James 15. 16. amd 1. 19, 20. The ≈øincere Chri≈øtian doth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170417:109"/> it with love to God and man, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. 1 Cor. 13. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 8. Hee doth it not with the leaven of malice tnd wickedne≈øs, but with the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread of ≈øinceritie and truth.</p>
               <p>10 He doth it purely and holily. The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian is not onely pure for the manner, but it flows from pure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and motives; and is done by a pure rule, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o pure ends.</p>
               <p>2 It comes from a pure heart. That of the Hypocrite comes from a filthy heart, <hi>Acts 8. 21, 22. Mat.</hi> 23. 25. But this of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian comes from a pure heart, a heart purified by the blood of Chri≈øt, and by the Spirit of Chri≈øt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5,</p>
               <p>2 It is pure in the motives. by, and from which it is moved and carried. That which doth move and carry the Hypocrite in his obedience, is his ≈øelf-love, and ≈øelf-ends, and not any thing at all of God: he loveth not the commander, the command, nor the thing commanded for them≈øelves. Or if there be any thing of God in it, it is ≈øo much only as may ≈øerve his own ends therein, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. throughout. So <hi>Jehu.

               <p>Hee may ≈øometimes bee kept from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil perhaps by the fear of men, but very ≈øeldom by the fear of God, <hi>Mark 12. 12. Luke</hi>

But that e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which doth move the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian in his obedience, is the love and fear of God. And from thence his de≈øire to plea≈øe, and his feare to offend God, the goodne≈øs of the thing to bee done or ≈øuffered, the con≈øcience of his duty therein, and of his obligation thereunto by the love of God. Hee beleeves the promi≈øes becau≈øe God ≈øaith, and obeyes the commands becau≈øe God gives them. He loves the Law maker that commands, the Law or command it ≈øelf, and the thing commanded. The≈øe, and ≈øuch like things as the≈øe doe e≈øpecially ≈øtir up, and carry on the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian to his obedience. So <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By Faith Noah being warned of God of things not ≈øeen, moved with fear prepared an Ark,</hi> &amp;c. P≈øalm 119. 161. <hi>My heart standeth in awe of thy word,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>For the love of Christ con≈øtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c. 1. 17. <hi>Some out of love,</hi> P≈øalm 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>2 It is pure in the Rule by which his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is governed. The Hypocrite, he makes his own fancie, and the commands and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men his rule and warrant for what he doth therein. Mat. 15. 2. <hi>Why doe thy di≈øciples tran≈øgre≈øs the traditions of the Elders?</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 1. 14. John 4. 21, 22. Acts 17. 22. Mat. 23. 16, 17. But the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian, he makes the pure Word of God alone his rul e and warrant for what≈øoever he beleeveth, doth and ≈øuffereth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.

               <p>3 It is al≈øo pure for the manner of it, as is already ≈øhewed.</p>
               <p>4 This new obedience is pure in the ends of it. The Hypocrites end in all that he doth and ≈øuffereth is him≈øelf, as he is moved in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ≈øelf-love, ≈øo is he carried to ≈øelf-ends. He ≈øeeks him≈øelf, not God and Chri≈øt, his main de≈øign and intention in all that hee doth and ≈øuffereth from the beginning to the end thereof, is e≈øpecially, if not only his own glory or prai≈øe, his own profit, or plea≈øure, or ≈øome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ≈øatisfie his own lu≈øts. He lookes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than at earthly plea≈øures, comforts, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in this world. God is not in al his thoughts, or if hee be, it is onely to thinke how hee may ≈øerve him≈øelf upon him. And if God be in his eye, yet he lookes at ≈øomething beyond, above,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170417:111"/> above or before him. In ≈øhew he ≈øeeks God, but in truth he ≈øeeks him≈øelf. He ≈øeems to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God and Chri≈øt, but it is not for God and Chri≈øt, but for his own ≈øake. He follows Chri≈øt for the loaves, as the nine Leapers to be healed onely, <hi>Iohn 6. 26. Luke</hi> 17. 12. And as the ≈øheep doe follow the ≈øhepheard as long as the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of hay is in his hand, and no longer; and not as a childe that follows the father out of love, who wil follow him every where. The Phari≈øees did pray and give almes to be ≈øeen of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. They made long praiers to the end they might devoure widowes hou≈øes. <hi>Ho≈øea 7. 14.

Acts 20 30. Phil. 1. 17. <hi>Preached Christ out of envy.</hi> But the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian in all his active and pa≈ø≈øive obedience, as hee is carryed forth therein e≈øpecially from the love and feare of God and Chri≈øt, ≈øo doth he act therein for God and Chri≈øt as well as for him≈øelf. And indeed God is his great object, motive, end, and all in all: He followeth them as wel for their owne ≈øakes as for his owne ≈øake. They are his principal and ultimate end, and the center to which he tends in all that he doth and ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. His main ≈øcope and ≈øpecial aim therein to which all is in his intention referred is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170417:111"/> God, and advance the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, and to te≈øtifie his love to God; for the love of God ≈øhewed to him in Chri≈øt. And therefore it doth not ≈øatisfie him to do any thing as for the publick good, the Common wealth, or the like. So the Heathen men have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs he goe higher, and ≈øhoot as far as the utmo≈øt white and mark of all, which is Gods glory; he cannot be ≈øatisfied to come ≈øhort of this, or to goe beyond it with reference to any thing el≈øe.

               <p>And next to Gods glory the true Chri≈øtian he doth in his obedience active and pa≈ø≈øive aim at, and de≈øign the good of all men, e≈øpecially of godly men: So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 33. <hi>Even as I not ≈øeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ≈øaved.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13. 36. <hi>After hee had ≈øerved his own generation,</hi> &amp;c.

            <argument>
               <p>How Sinceritie and Hypocri≈øie are manife≈øted. <hi>Or,</hi> The ≈øigns of Sinceritie and of Hypocri≈øie.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>This que≈øtion is partly an≈øwered before in <hi>Chapter</hi> 3. where wee have ≈øet forth, wherein Sinceritie and Hypocri≈øie doe con≈øi≈øt. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. wherein we have ≈øhewed, in what the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian doth differ from, and goe beyond the Hypocrite. But wee ≈øhall now in this place adde further ≈øome particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sincerity and Hypocri≈øie doe mo≈øt eminently ≈øhew them≈øelves in the Profe≈ø≈øors of Religion, and the≈øe al≈øo may ≈øerve for ≈øigns and markes thereof. And the≈øe wee ≈øhall al≈øo lay down the one aghin≈øt the other in way of oppo≈øition. But herein wee mu≈øt premi≈øe four things by way of caution.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That among≈øt the≈øe ≈øigns of Hypocri≈øie, ≈øome are more gro≈ø≈øe and palpable than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That neither the one, nor the other, on the one or on the other ≈øide, albeit they bee certaine and infallible in them≈øelves, yet may they not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170417:117"/> be ≈øo to us, who≈øe hearts are deceitful above all things, and wee are ≈øo apt to bee deceived by them. Wee doe not propo≈øe them therefore as ao≈øolutely certaine and infallible as to us: For many of the things wee give, and lay downe through this whole worke as ≈øignes or markes of the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian, ≈øome appearance of the ≈øame things may be found in, and upon the Hypocrite. As for example. Hee may ≈øeem to have ≈øome delight in God. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. Hee may have ≈øome delight in good things. Matth. 13. 20. Marke 6. 20. I≈øaiah 58. 2. and good men and their company. <hi>Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> So the fooli≈øh ≈øeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the company of the wi≈øe Virgins. Hee may have an appearance of all the graces of the Spirit within him, and ≈øeem to grow in them for a long time, perhaps to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. <hi>Mat. 13. 4, 5, 6. 20, 21, 22. Luke 6. 46.</hi> Hee may bee a con≈øtant Hearer of the VVord of GOD, and yeeld ≈øome obedience thereunto, as <hi>Herod, Amaziah,</hi> and others. 2 <hi>Chronicl. 25. 2, 9, 15, 16. Luke 6, 46, 47. Mark</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. Hee may deny him≈øelf in many things, avoyd evill, and repent of ≈øinne, as <hi>Ahab, Saul, Judas,</hi> others, and doe many other things, as we have before layd down at large. And on the other ≈øide, many of the things wee
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170417:118"/> have ob≈øerved, or ≈øhall here further ob≈øerve to be the ≈øignes, or marks, or workings of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri≈øie. The likene≈øs, or re≈øemblance, or (at the lea≈øt) ≈øome degrees thereof, or the thing it ≈øelf at ≈øome iime may be found in the ≈øincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian. As for example, we read of them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or of ≈øome of them, at ≈øome time, or in ≈øome ca≈øe unbelieving, <hi>Mat. 14. 31. Rom. 14. 23. Mat.</hi> 6. 30.

So now we finde it by ≈øad expirience, That the≈øe, and ≈øuch like evils are to be found too often ≈øtirring in the hearts and lives of the be≈øt Chri≈øtians. And the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of their being in the true Chri≈øtian and the Hypocrite wee have opened in another place.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we doe not pre≈øently judge a man to be an Hypocrite in his ≈øtate becau≈øe he hath ≈øom Hypocri≈øie in him: For there is not a man that lives but hath Hypocri≈øie in him more or le≈ø≈øe: Be≈øides that, every man is born an Hypocrite For of this ≈øinne as of all others wee have the ≈øeeds in our natures. But no man is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Hypocrite in his ≈øtate but ≈øuch a one as is under the reign and power of Hypocri≈øie, and that yeelds him≈øelfe up to it to obey it, an ob≈øtinate and wilful Hypocrite. And not ≈øuch
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170417:119"/> a one as doth ≈øee it in him≈øelfe, dete≈øt, di≈øavow, bewaile it, and labour again≈øt it all hee can, he is not an Hypocrite albeit he have hypocri≈øie in him.</p>
            <p>4 And therefore in the next place this is e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the conclu≈øion which wee draw from all the≈øe things (as I have formerly intimated.) That rhe more of all the ≈øignes or marks of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie are to be found in, or upon any one man, the more evidence hee in whom they are found may have for his ≈øinceritie. And the more of the ≈øignes of Hypocri≈øie are to bee found in any one man, the more cau≈øe hee in whom the ≈øame is found hath to ≈øu≈øpect him≈øelfe thereof. The ≈øigns or marks follow.</p>

               <p>1 It ≈øavoureth much of ≈øinceritie, and it is very much a ≈øign of a ≈øincere man, That he do e≈øteem, value, and preferre God and Chri≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and that he do in all things ≈øeek God and Chri≈øt above him≈øelfe, and above all men and things.

And as the natural body by a di≈øtemper, from a di≈øea≈øe, a blow on the head, or ≈øome other accident may lye a while for dead, ≈øo it is with the ≈øpiritual body of the new man, and with his ≈øpiritual ≈øtrength. It may be by ≈øome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pre≈ø≈øures and burdens of affliction, or temptation (for the pre≈øent) brought to a very low and weak e≈øtate, and perhaps into a kinde of ≈øwound, to have in appearance very little or no ≈øign of life left, but to bee as it were ≈øtarke dead. But there are another ≈øort of weake Chri≈øtians, and they are ≈øuch as were never ≈øtronger. And ≈øuch are (for the mo≈øt part) all Chri≈øtians at their fir≈øt comming into Chri≈øt, they are rude, and raw, and have but little faith; ≈øuch were Chri≈øts di≈øciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 30. and 8. 26. and 16. 8. <hi>Mark 9 19, 24.

So little of ≈øpiritual life, or the life of the new creature may appear for a long time in that ≈øoul which may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding be quickned and truly alive to God in Chri≈øt.

               <p>The trial of the ≈øinceritie of works. And what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to make a work good.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd now from the tryal of the ≈øincerity of Per≈øons and hearts we come to the tryal of the ≈øinceritie of Workes and Services. And for this we are to know, That there are many things required, whereunto the ≈øincere Chri≈øtian hath re≈øpect, for the making of a ≈øervice and worke good, or a ≈øuffering acceptable. There is ≈øome thing repuired in the per≈øon doing or ≈øuffering. And ≈øome things there are required in the thing to be done and ≈øuffered. 1 In the per≈øon doing or ≈øuffering it is requi≈øite, that he be rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170417:139"/> 2 In the thing to be done or ≈øuffered. 1 It is requi≈øite it be done by a right rule or warrant. 2 In a right manner. 3 And to right ends. For the qualification of the per≈øon doing or ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is requi≈øite that hee be in Chri≈øt by faith, and ≈øo one with him, and thereby become a new creature, a childe of God. <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. and ≈øo accepted in his per≈øon, for otherwi≈øe his worke cannot be accepted. For God mu≈øt fir≈øt have re≈øpect to him, ere he will have re≈øpect to his offering or ≈øervice. Dent. 33. 10, 11. <hi>They ≈øhall teach Iacob, &amp;c and accept the works of his hands.</hi> Gen. 4. 4, 5. <hi>And the Lord had re≈øpect to Abel and to his offering.</hi> But God heareth not ≈øinners.

P≈øal. 45. 13, 14. 2 For the thing to bee done and ≈øuffered. 1 It mu≈øt come from a right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, from the Spirit of God in this new man, and from his renewed nature. 2 As a con≈øequent of the former, it mu≈øt be done by him out of a pure heart (that is) a con≈øcience that doth not know of any guilt or of wilfull wickedne≈øs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or man upon it, but that it doth in al things de≈øire to live according to the Word of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. &amp; 24. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. 1 Tim. 1. 5. <hi>Now the end of the commandement is love out of a pure heart,

For the fir≈øt. The thing to be done mu≈øt be good, either it mu≈øt be commanded, or at lea≈øt it mu≈øt not be forbidden by Gods Word. For if ≈øo it be that the

And of this nature is their Popi≈øh whipping of them≈øelves, pilgrimage, fa≈øting, and ≈øuch like things among≈øt them, and the imitation of them by others.

And yet Gods ≈øervants in the things they have done and ≈øuffered, have had an eye, yea a fixed and con≈øtant eye upon their owne temporal and eternal good al≈øo for their encouragement therein, Heb. 11. 14, 26. <hi>For

               <p>Our fifth word of Exhortation is to all men profe≈ø≈øing Religion, That ≈øeeing it is ≈øo (as wee have ≈øhewed) That ≈øo many goe ≈øo far towards,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170417:151"/> and yet go without it; they ≈øtrive for it, and yet cannot get it, that we ≈øtrive the more earne≈øtly, and labour the more abundantly herein. And this is the very u≈øe that our Saviour doth make of this point. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 23, 24. <hi>Lord, are there few that ≈øhall be ≈øaved? And he ≈øaid nnto them, ≈øtrive to enter in at the ≈øtrait gate, &amp;c.</hi> Shall we come ≈øo near to it and goe without it? <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. Shall we doe and ≈øuffer ≈øo much for it in vain? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. Shall we get on Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> in ≈øight of <hi>Canaan</hi> and not enter it? Shall we bid almo≈øt to one penny the full price for Chri≈øt, and let another come after us and take away our bargain from us? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Let us re≈øolve, though it co≈øt us our blood we will have it, and that we will goe beyond all the Hypocrites in the world, let them go as far as they can. But happily ≈øome man may ≈øay here, To what purpo≈øe ≈øhall we ≈øtrive if there be ≈øuch a difficulty in it; it is impo≈ø≈øible by all the labour in the world to be done. To this we an≈øwer. 1 It is certain the work is hard &amp; difficult, and yet it is not ≈øo hard as to be impo≈ø≈øible, but it is po≈ø≈øible may be done. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. 2 There is no po≈ø≈øibilitie of having it without this paines and labour. And it will bee therefore in this, as in men that are eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a place or office for which many do ≈øtand each of which and no others are capable; in this ca≈øe any one of them that ≈øtand for it may po≈ø≈øibly have it, but hee that never labours
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170417:152"/> for it will never have it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. ≈øhould not this provoke a man to labour the more for it. And ≈øo ≈øhould the difficultie in this ca≈øe provoke all men to be the more indu≈øtrious to attain it. 3 If we have it not we are without que≈øtion, &amp; ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably lo≈øt and undone for ever. Our ca≈øe in this therefore is like the Leprous men, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 4. If we ≈øit ≈øtill in our naturall and impenitent e≈øtate, we are ≈øure to dye there. Let us therefore re≈øolve as they did, <hi>Let us fall into the ho≈øt of the Syrians, if they ≈øave us alive we ≈øhall live; and if they kill us we ≈øhall but die.</hi> So let us ≈øay, we will doe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt for heaven, we will put our ≈øelves upon the mercy of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and ≈øtrive with all our might for heaven, if we peri≈øh, we peri≈øh, we can but dye. 4 But in the la≈øt place: If we ≈øhall doe our utmo≈øt endeavour in truth to attaine it, we have no cau≈øe to doubt the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Gods grace, and our acceptance and ≈øucce≈øs the rein; for God is gracious, and Chri≈øt is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and hath promi≈øed ≈øo to doe, and he is faithful and able to perform what he promi≈øeth. <hi>Math.</hi> 11 28.

            <p>IF any now ≈øhall de≈øire and will labour for ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and would know by what meanes he

Let him labour to be ≈øincere in his ≈øtate in general, for till this, it cannot be expected he ≈øhould do any thing in ≈øinceritie. 2. Let him labour to get the Spirit of God into his heart and by this to get a newheart a heart convinced of ≈øin by the worke of the Law. <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 10.

And when there is a full and powerfull change of the whole man by the grace of God, then, and not till then doth he begin to be ≈øincere. For every mans heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is deceitfull above all things, and till God hath changed it there is no integritie in it, and a mans heart is never plaine and even till it be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed by grace for till this be, a man makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe the center, and all lines to meete in him.

And let the feare of the≈øe judgements take hold of him Prov. 14. 2. <hi>Hee that walketh in his uprightnes feareth the Lord.</hi> 2 Sam. 22. 24. <hi>For all his judgements were before me</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was al≈øo upright &amp;c.</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>Know thou the God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ≈øerve him with a perfect heart, for the Lord ≈øearcheth all hearts &amp;c.</hi> Job. 31. 4, 23. <hi>Doth hee not ≈øee my wayes and count all my ≈øteps, P≈øal.</hi> 50. 21, 22.

That by grace in this Que≈øtion we meane ≈øomething inherent in us (be what it will, Act or di≈øpo≈øition, or habit or any other quality what≈øoever) and therefore the favour and love of God to his people (commonly call'd grace in Scripture) comes not now into con≈øideration. 1.

That this a≈ø≈øertion (as 'tis here expre≈øs'd) is evidently untrue for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding and will are ≈øo far from being the ≈øame <hi>in ≈øpecie,</hi> (for that's the Samene≈ø≈øe meant) that all who know any thing almo≈øt in Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or Schoole.

But if by the≈øe words <hi>[Our under≈øtandings, and wills are phy≈øically the ≈øame]</hi> this be meant, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings of all men in the world are ≈øpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ≈øame, and the wills of all men in the world are ≈øoe too; This is granted, as evidently true.

Yes, 'tis evident they may. The demon≈øtrative knowledge of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and Geometry, the artificiall knowledge of a Taylor or Shoomaker, the ≈øupernaturall knowledge of God in Je≈øus Cbri≈øt, wrought in the hart of true beleivers by the holy Gho≈øt, all the≈øe (I ≈øay) are vinvocally knowledge, and yet I beleive none will, (≈øure I am none truely can) ≈øay, that all the≈øe are ≈øpecifically the ≈øame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and differ onely gradually. 2. But if any ≈øhould ≈øay otherwi≈øe, I ≈øhall de≈øire him to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>1. That the knowledge of God in Je≈øus Chri≈øt (I mean the knowledge of him by a lively faith) wrought in the hart of a true beleiver by the holy Gho≈øt, is a divine knowledge <hi>(&amp; ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne principii √† quo, &amp; objecti in quod tendit)</hi> the other but humane.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170417:172"/> come, are as far different, as heaven and earth. 2. That they have far different Acts; the one being a gratious ≈øanctifying Act, the other not: the one ≈øuch as may be in any wicked per≈øon, nay and actually is in the Devil him≈øelf for I doubt not, but notwith≈øtanding all his badne≈ø≈øe, he may be (and is) a good Mathematition) whereas the other never is, nor can be in any but a regenerate per≈øon. 3. Were there onely a graduall difference, then the humane, and (as is ≈øuppo≈øed) the le≈ø≈øe knowledge, might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into a Divine and ≈øaveing knowledge, by addition of further degrees. But this is ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impo≈ø≈øible; for let our knowledge in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, or Arithmerique (for in≈øtance) be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the utmo≈øt, as high as there is any po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of knowing tho≈øe objects, yet they can never come to be Divine, and ≈øanctifying, or ≈øaveing knowledge, but remain ≈øtill <hi>barely huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> naturall, or artificiall cognitions, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and I thinke, will not be deny'd.</p>

But it being granted (as it is that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, and will in ≈øeverall men (as in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites &amp; regenerate per≈øons) are not ≈øpecifically di≈øtinct, yet it neither does, nor can follow, but their acts may, and that even about the ≈øame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

               <hi>Con≈øid.</hi> 6. When it is ≈øaid, <hi>That the Acts, and exerci≈øe of common and ≈øpeciall grace differ only in degree and ≈øo the difference between common and ≈øpeciall grace is only graduall, and not ≈øpecificall</hi> I conceave (with a willing, and humble ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to better jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements) that this po≈øition is not true, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with the ju≈øt, and known principles of Divinity, or true Philo≈øophy My rea≈øons for this a≈ø≈øertion are the≈øe, and ≈øuch like.</p>
            <p>1. I ≈øuppo≈øe actions evangelically good, and well plea≈øing to God, may differ ≈øpecifically ≈øometimes: as an Act of ≈øaveing faith, and an Act of true charity, doe differ ≈øpecifically, though both of them evangelically good, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170417:174"/> well-plea≈øing to God. Sometimes they may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only gradually, as haveing ≈øeverall degrees of perfection within the ≈øame ≈øpecies. As the lea≈øt mea≈øure and degree of true ju≈øtifying faith, ('tis evident that ≈øuch faith is capable of degrees) differ from the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øaveing beleif onely in degrees. For, <hi>bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ≈øpecie</hi> (nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall di≈øtinction in this ca≈øe come not into con≈øideration) cannot po≈ø≈øibly differ more than gradually. But now acts of common grace in hypocrites, and irregnerate per≈øons differ more then ≈øo, from acts of ≈øpeciall grace in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. For 'tis certain, that <hi>Bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ≈øpecie,</hi> neither doe, nor can differ ≈øo much as <hi>Bonum &amp; malum.</hi> There being manife≈øtly a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repugnancy between good and evill, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two good things onely gradually diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: the≈øe ≈øtanding in a naturall ≈øubordination the one to the other, the le≈ø≈øer degree to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which when it comes con≈øi≈øts with the le≈ø≈øe degree, and perfects it. But tho≈øe ≈øtand in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and formal oppo≈øition, good and evil being incon≈øi≈øtent, and naturally de≈øtructive of each other. As a greater, and le≈ø≈øer degree of heate (in a naturall way) will agree well enough, whereas heate and cold are incompatible. I≈øay <hi>bonum &amp; bonum in eadem ≈øpecie,</hi> differ not ≈øo much as <hi>bonum &amp; malum:</hi> but acts of common grace in hypocrites, and ≈øaveing grace in the regenerate,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170417:174"/> are ≈øuch: the Acts of ≈øaveing grace being evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically good, and well plea≈øing to God, the Acts of common grace in hypocrites &amp; unregenerate per≈øons not ≈øo, being neither evangelically good, nor well plea≈øing to God. For what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ≈øpeciou≈øne≈øs ≈øoever they may have, yet when (all circum≈øtances are con≈øidered) they are examined by the rules of the law, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, 'tis certain they are, and ever will be found onely <hi>Splendida peccata</hi> (as the Father calls them) <hi>Splendida</hi> perhaps, yet <hi>peccata,</hi> and ≈øo not plea≈øing to God. And this ≈øeemes to me evident enough.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe, <hi>without faith 'tis impo≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe God.</hi> And therefore tho≈øe acts of common grace in hypocrites (who have not ≈øuch ≈øaving faith as the Apo≈øtle there ≈øpeakes of) are not plea≈øing unto God, nor Evangelically good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hypocrites, and irregenerate per≈øons are not (in the ≈øen≈øe of the Go≈øpel) <hi>good trees,</hi> and therefore cannot bring forth gaod fruit.

            <p>2. I de≈øire it may be con≈øidered, that is is (and upon evident rea≈øon) <note n="g" place="margin">M. <hi>Baxters Saints everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting re≈øt.</hi> pag. 225.</note> confe≈ø≈øed that the Acts of common and ≈øpeciall grace (as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally con≈øidered) differ ≈øpecifically, and not onely in degrees: whence it followes; that when the Que≈øtion is put, How common and ≈øpeciall grace differ? the An≈øwere mu≈øt ever be affirmative, that they differ <hi>Specie, Non gradu ≈øolum.</hi> The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the Acts of the will, and under≈øtanding are ≈øaveing graces in their

And therefore if in their morall con≈øideration they ≈øtill differ ≈øpecifically from common graces, it can never (with any congruity) be affirmed, that in any other con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration they differ onely gradually. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, when 'tis ≈øaid, that in their naturall, and phy≈øicall con≈øideration they differ onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. I reply, that the Acts of the will, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding in that con≈øideration, are not ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing graces at all; and therefore, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in that con≈øideration, they differ onely gradually; yet it will not thence follow, that common and ≈øpecial graces differ onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ≈øuch acts of the Will, and Under≈øtanding, So con≈øidered, being no graces at all. For this Argument <hi>[common and ≈øpeciall beleife as they are phy≈øically con≈øidered, differ onely gradually go.

Now that tho≈øe Acts of the will &amp; udder≈øtanding (≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing faith, and ≈øaveing love) as they are phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally con≈øidered, are no ≈øaveing graces at all, will (if I mi≈øtake not) appeare.</p>

Becau≈øe ≈øaveing love and beleife, are ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and ≈øaveing graces onely in a morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration, as is confe≈ø≈øed by that <note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Baxter in his Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Re≈øt.</hi> pag. 226.</note> reverend, and learned per≈øon, again≈øt who≈øe hypothe≈øis we now rea≈øon.

So that he that ≈øaith, common and ≈øaveing graces are ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically di≈øtinct in their morall confideration, ≈øaith they are ab≈øolutely, and onely ≈øo di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed, becau≈øe they are ≈øaveing graces in no con≈øideration but that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con≈øid</hi> 8. It is to be con≈øidered, that common and ≈øpeciall graces con≈øi≈øt not ≈øo properly, and primarily in the Acts, and exerci≈øe of faith and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170417:176"/> love <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in the habits, and principle from whence they come: So that the gratiou≈øne≈øs which is in them (as <hi>Suares,</hi> and ≈øome others tell us) is not, <hi>ip≈øis actibus originaliter intrin≈øeca, ≈øed a principio, &amp; habitu unde fluunt derivata.</hi> For in≈øtance, the gratiou≈øne≈ø≈øe of our actuall faith or love doth not con≈øi≈øt ≈øo much in the ≈øub≈øtance, and nature of the Act phy≈øically con≈øidered, (which is the naturall product of the naturall faculty from whence it flowes) as in the circum≈øtance, the <hi>modus,</hi> and mea≈øure of it, from which its <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe,</hi> and conformity with the Law ari≈øeth, and this it hath from the principle, and habit from whence it flowes. For as the habit is more inten≈øe or remi≈ø≈øe, more perfect or imperfect, So pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably is the Act which proceeds from it. 'Tis true, to beleive, or love, or hate (if ≈øimply con≈øidered, <hi>quoad ≈øub≈øtantiam actus)</hi> are naturall effects, and phy≈øicall products of our will, and under≈øtanding, ≈øuch as tho≈øe faculties can, (and many times doe) produce without the helpe of any habit, But if the manner, and mea≈øure of tho≈øe Acts be con≈øidered (that we beleive, or love <hi>modo debito,</hi> with facility, cheerfullne≈øs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy) this (in which the gratiou≈øne≈øs of the Act con≈øi≈øts) they owe to the habits, or graces ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the faculties, and naturall powers from whence they proceed.</p>
            <p>2. And as the habits are (common or ≈øpeciall)
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170417:177"/> graces in order of nature allways, and mo≈øtly in order of time before the Acts (the≈øe being the effects of tho≈øe) So they are far more con≈øi≈øting, and permanent. The acts are ≈øo tran≈øitory and vani≈øhing, that a little ≈øleepe, or ≈øowneing, an inadvertency of that bui≈øine≈ø≈øe about which we are, or intention of other bui≈øine≈ø≈øe, robbs us of them: but the habits are more fix'd and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their inherence and denomination. So that from them men are call'd (and are) truely gratious, even when they have no Act of grace to give them that denomination; otherwi≈øe we ≈øhould (when we go to ≈øleep) put of our graces with our clothes, &amp; he that was a gratious man now, immediately be none.</p>
            <p>Seing then that <hi>habits</hi> doe <hi>prins &amp; principalius</hi> denominate us gratious, therefore they are more properly and principally to be e≈øteemed (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or ≈øpeciall) graces: and then it ≈øeemes to me to follow, that he that inquires, whether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon and ≈øpeciall graces differ ≈øpecifically, or onely gradually, ≈øhould (if he will rationally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) fir≈øt, and principally inquire concerneing the habits of common and ≈øpeciall grace, and then ≈øecondarily concerneing the Acts, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of tho≈øe habits. The rea≈øon is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe the Acts have their gratiou≈øne≈ø≈øe from the habits, but not <hi>(Vicevers√¢)</hi> the habits from the Acts, and go the Acts cannot po≈ø≈øibly

To bring all this home to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent purpo≈øe: I grant, that common, and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veingly beleiveing Chri≈øtians may beleive the≈øe, (and ≈øuch like) conclu≈øions <hi>[Chri≈øt dyed for us, ≈øatisfyed Gods ju≈øtice, interceeds for us with his Father. &amp;c.]</hi> to be divine truthes. 2 But they can have no greater a≈ø≈øurance of the divine truth of the≈øe conclu≈øions, then they have of the <hi>mediums,</hi> and premi≈ø≈øes which inferre them. 3. Hypocrites, and impious per≈øons who may have common faith,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170417:201"/> have no premi≈ø≈øes to inferre them, but ≈øuch as are humane, and dubious, at lea≈øt not ab≈øolutely infallible, that is they have onely Topicall, and probable arguments, ≈øuch as the authority of their teachers, of councells, Fathers, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be ≈øaid they have Scripture for them; I reply, that the ≈øame Que≈øtion returnes: what <hi>mediums,</hi> and motives have they to beleive that to be Gods word? for their a≈ø≈øent to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth of Gods word, can be no firmer, and certaine, then the premi≈ø≈øes which inferre that a≈ø≈øent. Now Hypocrites neither have, (nor can have) any premi≈ø≈øes, or motives to beleive the Divinity of that word, but ≈øuch as I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is Topical, and probable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>ergo</hi> their a≈ø≈øent (proportionable to tho≈øe motives) mu≈øt (of nece≈ø≈øity) be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and opinative.</p>
            <p>But on the other ≈øide, regenerate per≈øons, who are borne of God, and have true ≈øaveing faith, have ≈øurer, and more infallible principles which induce them to beleive and know the divine truth of tho≈øe conclu≈øions.
